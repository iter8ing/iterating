Work friends. School friends. Old school friends. Digital friends.</p><p>Each in their own category. </p><p>Never the two shall mix.</p><p>I don't know why I'd do that.</p><p>In the few times they did actually interact, it felt like some wacky crossover episode had taken place, and I didn't quite know how to act.</p><p>For you see, in each circle, I was a different version of "me."</p><p>I see that now.</p><p>I didn't see it then.</p><p>The reason I didn't overlap the circles was because I didn't know how to be <em>me</em> when they mixed.</p><p>Was I school Alex? Work Alex? OG Alex? Digital Alex?</p><p>Very few have seen me with my hair down, so to speak, and that's probably for the best.</p><p>The point of all this is how so many haven't changed. And how so many have.</p><p>And I don't know which one is better: Those who haven't changed and those who have.</p><p>I know I've changed.</p><p>I still don't venn diagram my life. But there are no separate circles, now. Just one special one.</p><p>I sit in it and pilot it around this vast program called reality. My copilots actively keeping everything running, while I try to keep us on course.</p><p>Every now and again, another circle, past or future, approaches.</p><p>I let them bounce, though.</p><p>They don't get in.</p><p>This is the hermit in me, I know.</p><p>But the fella they're looking for is long gone.</p><p>Went to never never land and never came home.</p><p>...Did they leave yet?</p><p>Ok, good.</p><p>I know who I am now.</p><p>I know how to play it.</p><p>I am bubbles clustered together. So many.</p><p>That one day popped into one big bubble.</p><p>I believe in the sanctity of this bubble. </p><p>I <em>sacralize</em> it.</p><p>There is no place in the world I would rather be, than where I am right now. With who I am with right now.</p><p>Floating through the cosmos.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
