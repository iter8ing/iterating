Not only do they have no shame, they shame their viewers. </p><p>They shame their donors!</p><p><em>How dare you not give to me. After all I've done (nothing but asking for money).</em></p><p>It's psychology.</p><p>Weeds out a lot.</p><p>How scams often contain typos and bad grammar intentionally. For it weeds out everyone else so only the most susceptible are left.</p><p>Easy pickings.</p><p>Anyone who gives money to someone in need is a saint.</p><p>But giving money to a stranger online because they demand you do so is an interesting consequence of, I think(?), loneliness.</p><p>People want to hear their name out loud. Want to be thanked. Want to be shamed, even.</p><p>Shame is many things, but it's not alone, especially amongst Koreans.</p><p>So all of that to say, here is my Venmo:</p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>But if you're offering...</p><p>Nah, what am I saying!?!</p><p>Listen, if you're cutting checks...</p><p>Is that what they still say? Cutting checks?</p><p>I think that's right.</p><p>I hope it's all some sort of artistic statement. Begging streams. Some sort of ironic tragecomedy.</p><p>Like those pranks they play on people just to see what they do.</p><p>And they film it.</p><p>But I know, I know, somehow, that would be worse.</p><p>There's a picture of near century old Billy Shatner eating a bowl of cereal from the driver's seat of his car.</p><p>And I've seen a lot of folks saying that is their goal.</p><p>To be able to live with that zero of an eff to give.</p><p>I just see negligence (or self-driving) at best.</p><p>And I love Bill Shat.</p><p>So he gets a pass.</p><p>But begging for money live streaming is just stratospherically worse.</p><p>But I dig the chutzpah.</p><p>Shameful, but ballsy.</p><p>So these digital folks with their pixeled palms out, I'm hoping its some weird ai thing. But I know it ain't.</p><p>I know it ain't.</p><p>It's as real as anything is these days.</p><p>This coming from an optimist.</p><p>Tick tock, tick tock...</p><p>⏰ = 💰</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
