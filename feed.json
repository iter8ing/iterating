And with my time at a premium, it felt like a waste of valuable minutes when I could be, should be, focusing on other things.</p>\n<p>But like with <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">really, really few, almost never really,</span>many things, I was wrong.</p>\n<p>I've learned that a little bit of typing time is a wonderful thing.</p>\n<p>It amplifies the rest of my day.</p>\n<p>Maybe by turning gears, removing cobwebs, warming me up. Who knows.</p>\n<p>I'm starting to think, \"Oh, I should write about that.\"</p>\n<p>So thanks for that, digital notebook made by a fruit, for letting me do just that. Too many thats.</p>\n<p>There's memories in my muscles. My fingers. And tapping them repetitively on little squares have helped me in more ways than I could have imagined.</p>\n<p>A return to first principles.</p>\n<p>Start from the foundation.</p>\n<p>One tap at a time.</p>\n<p>1.</p>\n<p>2.</p>\n<p>3.</p>\n<p>Unlocking levels long forgotten. </p>\n<p>Unlocking levels yet to attain.</p>\n<p>I'm rereading books and learning how much I had missed the first few times around. Seeing the whole world through these new, old, lenses.</p>\n<p>And how much <em>perspective</em> has to do with everyone and everything.</p>\n<p>I don't know what I'm getting at.</p>\n<p>I'm just glad I get to write.</p>\n<p>[Finger guns!]</p>",
