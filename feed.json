Not only do they have no shame, they shame their viewers. </p>\n<p>They shame their donors!</p>\n<p><em>How dare you not give to me. After all I've done (nothing but asking for money).</em></p>\n<p>It's the smart play.</p>\n<p>Weeds out a lot.</p>\n<p>Like how scams often contain typos and bad grammar intentionally. For it filters out everyone else so only the most susceptible are left.</p>\n<p>Easy pickings.</p>\n<p>Anyone who gives money to someone in need is a saint.</p>\n<p>But giving money to a stranger online because they demand you do so is an interesting consequence of, I think(?), analog loneliness.</p>\n<p>People want to hear their name out loud. Want to be thanked. Want to be shamed, even.</p>\n<p>They want a friend.</p>\n<p>Shame is many things, but it's not alone, especially amongst livestreams.</p>\n<p>So all of that to say, here is my Venmo:</p>\n<p>Just kidding.</p>\n<p>But if you're offering...</p>\n<p>I shouldn't joke.</p>\n<p>Listen, if you're cutting checks...</p>\n<p>Is that what they still say? Cutting checks?</p>\n<p>I think that's right.</p>\n<p>I hope it's all some sort of artistic statement. Begging streams. Some sort of ironic tragecomedy.</p>\n<p>Like those pranks they play on people just to see what they do.</p>\n<p>And they film it.</p>\n<p>But I know, I know, somehow, that would be worse.</p>\n<p>There's a picture of near century old Billy Shatner eating a bowl of cereal from the driver's seat of his car.</p>\n<p>And I've seen a lot of folks saying that is their goal.</p>\n<p>To be able to live with that zero of an eff to give.</p>\n<p>Eating corn flakes at a red light.</p>\n<p>I just see negligence (or self-driving) at best.</p>\n<p>And I love Bill Shat.</p>\n<p>So he gets a pass.</p>\n<p>But begging for money live streaming is just stratospherically worse.</p>\n<p>I dig the chutzpah, though.</p>\n<p>Shameful, but ballsy.</p>\n<p>So these digital folks with their pixeled palms out, I'm hoping its some weird ai thing. But I know it ain't.</p>\n<p>I know it ain't.</p>\n<p>It's as real as anything is these days.</p>\n<p>This coming from an optimist.</p>\n<p>Optimist Prime.</p>\n<p>Tick tock, tick tock...</p>\n<p>⏰ = 💰</p>\n<p>🥺</p>",

It took me a long time to learn that.</p>\n<p>Failure is necessarily implied to make accomplishment feel earned.</p>\n<p>If you are guaranteed a win, you will take it for granted.</p>\n<p>Who wants to hit 1.000?</p>\n<p>You think you do, but you really don't.</p>\n<p>But stacking failure on top of another on top of another, that's when things get rough.</p>\n<p>So that's one, to protect those you lead from the spiral failures.</p>\n<p>Sidenote: Work on not being right. Or at least, not feeling some sort of weird mix of vindication (\"I told you so\") and validation when you caution and warn and then it happens. You can almost see it coming. They can't. You cannot rewind, but memory is a great teacher, and you hope they remember how often you seem to know what you're talking about. Even and especially before it happens.</p>\n<p>I don't rely on people changing. </p>\n<p>I change.</p>\n<p>Either my angle or my position.</p>\n<p>Some mistakes are unforgivable.</p>\n<p>At least by me.</p>\n<p>Protect your loved ones from those.</p>\n<p>And so that's the dance.</p>\n<p>It seems delicate, but upon reflection there's a lot of room on the dance floor.</p>\n<p>There's a lot of space to play.</p>\n<p>But all the fun's at the edges.</p>\n<p>And thus, we dance.</p>",
