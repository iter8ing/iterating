Or too frequent. Or both.</p>\n<p>It's in these days where I have nothing to say that all the growth comes from.</p>\n<p>The hard reps.</p>\n<p>I use hard in a very narrow sense.</p>\n<p>This sheet easy.</p>\n<p>What can I pluck out of thin air and make something out of nothing?</p>\n<p>One of the basic tenets of martial arts is rhythm. </p>\n<p>When you see two people trained to fight, it's almost like they're dancing.</p>\n<p>One, two. One, two, three. One moves forward, the other back.</p>\n<p>There's an order there. </p>\n<p>That's why some wise folk say fighting a newbie or an untrained person can be very difficult. </p>\n<p>Rookies tend to be spastic. Unpredictable. Muscly. Tight. And just chaotic.</p>\n<p>You know what I mean?</p>\n<p>Crazy.</p>\n<p>And so, when you get really high up in this type of training, you learn a very advanced technique.</p>\n<p>After you have all the moves down, you're ready to start all over.</p>\n<p>Once you <em>have</em> rhythm, you must <em>break</em> it.</p>\n<p>Re-introducing chaos into the order of advanced combat.</p>\n<p>You spend years first mastering order to only then keep it spicy through mixing in chaos.</p>\n<p>One, two, one, one, one, two, three, four, one, high kick!</p>\n<p>Bad form, bad form, bad form, perfect execution!</p>\n<p>I always found that funny.</p>\n<p>At the height of controlled technique, liquid flow, of true mastery, is the most noob of tactics.</p>\n<p>Life is like that.</p>\n<p>In so many ways.</p>\n<p>An apex leads you right back to the beginning.</p>\n<p>Flailing, flailing, slap, slap, crisp cross.</p>\n<p><em>Bing!</em></p>\n<p>Don't try that ess with me, though.</p>\n<p>I'm so advanced I lock my arms out to my sides (T-pose) and just start spinning.</p>\n<p>Fools be running into these fists.</p>\n<p>Like a top.</p>\n<p>But, as I've said many many times, I am a man of peace.</p>\n<p>I just like to keep things spicy.</p>",
