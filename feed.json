            "content_html": "<p>Perhaps, I have figured out a way to keep writing.</p>\n<p>I took a typing class in eight grade that changed my life.</p>\n<p>We all worked on big mechanical metal typewriters and we learned by starting with the individual keys covered with little white stickers.</p>\n<p>We learned to type by feel. Not sight. Well, I think we had an overhead projector that showed where the keys were, but we couldn't look down at the keys for help.</p>\n<p>We had to train our fingers to know which letters they were responsible for.</p>\n<p>The pinkies had the least responsibility, whereas the index and middle got the brunt.</p>\n<p>Anyways, my point being, perhaps I can type with my eyes closed.</p>\n<p>I can peek at the keys but I know when my fingers strike true.</p>\n<p>This is not an ideal way to write, but I somehow feel more attuned to writing this way.</p>\n<p>My eyes aren't fighting the screen, I'm keeping them mostly closed, just my fingers hunting the board. I know this seems like a cruel twist of fate, but I have learned we just never know what's going to happen and that there is no sustained new normals.</p>\n<p>Only seasons. Windows of time.</p>\n<p>Take nothing for granted.</p>\n<p>I can type this way. Not sure how great I'll write. But I suppose you could have asked that all along.</p>\n<p>I can write with my eyes closed. What a blessing that is. I hope to share more substantive stuff in the near future. But forgive me any typos. </p>\n<p>The key to typing by feel is knowing where you are. I touch my index fingers together to make sure they are aligned and in the right position. Otherwise, it's anarchy.</p>\n<p>What I am learning is that I must write. If only for myself. And some times, many times, all the time, when you must have something, you are tested.</p>\n<p>So, I suppose, this is some sort of test.</p>\n<p>That's ok. </p>\n<p>And, as I have learned to say, even in nonoptimal conditions, what does this make possible?</p>\n<p>I just realized, for the first time ever, that the \"j\" and \"f\" keys (where your index fingers rest), have a little notch at the bottom. None of the other keys do. I think this is so you know where to orient them. Where to rest them.</p>\n<p>I remember doing that now. When learning to type. I would peel a corner of a sticker for each hand, so I could feel a certain letter. I'd peel the corner up on \"a\" and \"l\" keys so I knew where they were by feel, fi not by sight.</p>\n<p>Have \"f\" and \"j\" always been so distinguished? Weird, I never noticed.</p>\n<p>I will now. </p>\n<p>All because I starting writing by feel.</p>\n<p> </p>",
