But they're too good to let go. So you keep them. And you never win it all.</p>\n<p>That's my theory.</p>\n<p>So what would I do if I were running a pro team?</p>\n<p>Glad you asked.</p>\n<p>I'd do weird ess like draft a QB every year, even if I think we've got a winner already.</p>\n<p>Just stack 'em.</p>\n<p>Have the best backup in the league. And the best 3rd string. Always.</p>\n<p>Even draft 1st round QBs in consecutive years. Maybe three in a row. Get them rookie contracts on the cheap.</p>\n<p>Why not?</p>\n<p>Then I'd focus on the offensive line. Then all defense. And lastly, the skill players.</p>\n<p>I won't insult any QB by naming them, I think you know what I mean if you watched for any length of time. It's such an important position in today's game that you must get the decision right. And then when you do, protect it at all costs. Even if you have to keep competition flowing by bringing in their heir apparents yearly.</p>\n<p>Have the QB feel like he's got to earn the starting role every game, because he does.</p>\n<p>I'm not a one trick pony, though. </p>\n<p>I got other ideas. </p>\n<p>Like how we should make combine invitees run the 40 yard dash in full gear. Helmets and pads and all.</p>\n<p>To get a truer gauge of game speed.</p>\n<p>You like that shee, right?</p>\n<p>Of course, this is all just from the mind of a old(ish) flag football cornerback.</p>\n<p>But from my armchair, it's as clear as day.</p>\n<p>Now, where's Jon Gruden when I need him?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Coach, I got this theory...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>",
