Maybe a subscription.</p>\n<p>It's a little bit of cash or a little bit of time. </p>\n<p>And as much as I feel a bit torn about it all, I think ai is making some good music.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I said it.</p>\n<p>It follows the formula, and song is formula.</p>\n<p>Take for example the ai song \"New Year, I'm the Same ____\" (1979). I warn you it's got some adult language.</p>\n<p>Sheet rated R.</p>\n<p>But it's got oldies soul vibes with a modern (timeless?) IDGAF mindset.</p>\n<p>So yeah, I'm dancing to music created by software with the push of a few keys.</p>\n<p>No DJs yapping at the beginning to screw things up.</p>\n<p>No vulnerable cassettes eaten up by old, slowly disloyal, boomboxes.</p>\n<p>I'd encourage you to hold an iPhone sideways over your head rocking a Peter Gabriel song, but that just seems silly.</p>\n<p>There's no better time machine than music.</p>\n<p>A rare invention that can take you back, push you forward, and stir you up.</p>\n<p>All at the same time.</p>\n<p>Life is frequency.</p>\n<p>Life is vibe.</p>\n<p>Life is music.</p>\n<p>💽</p>",

Not only do they have no shame, they shame their viewers. </p>\n<p>They shame their donors!</p>\n<p><em>How dare you not give to me. After all I've done (nothing but asking for money).</em></p>\n<p>It's the smart play.</p>\n<p>Weeds out a lot.</p>\n<p>Like how scams often contain typos and bad grammar intentionally. For it filters out everyone else so only the most susceptible are left.</p>\n<p>Easy pickings.</p>\n<p>Anyone who gives money to someone in need is a saint.</p>\n<p>But giving money to a stranger online because they demand you do so is an interesting consequence of, I think(?), analog loneliness.</p>\n<p>People want to hear their name out loud. Want to be thanked. Want to be shamed, even.</p>\n<p>They want a friend.</p>\n<p>Shame is many things, but it's not alone, especially amongst livestreams.</p>\n<p>So all of that to say, here is my Venmo:</p>\n<p>Just kidding.</p>\n<p>But if you're offering...</p>\n<p>I shouldn't joke.</p>\n<p>Listen, if you're cutting checks...</p>\n<p>Is that what they still say? Cutting checks?</p>\n<p>I think that's right.</p>\n<p>I hope it's all some sort of artistic statement. Begging streams. Some sort of ironic tragecomedy.</p>\n<p>Like those pranks they play on people just to see what they do.</p>\n<p>And they film it.</p>\n<p>But I know, I know, somehow, that would be worse.</p>\n<p>There's a picture of near century old Billy Shatner eating a bowl of cereal from the driver's seat of his car.</p>\n<p>And I've seen a lot of folks saying that is their goal.</p>\n<p>To be able to live with that zero of an eff to give.</p>\n<p>Eating corn flakes at a red light.</p>\n<p>I just see negligence (or self-driving) at best.</p>\n<p>And I love Bill Shat.</p>\n<p>So he gets a pass.</p>\n<p>But begging for money live streaming is just stratospherically worse.</p>\n<p>I dig the chutzpah, though.</p>\n<p>Shameful, but ballsy.</p>\n<p>So these digital folks with their pixeled palms out, I'm hoping its some weird ai thing. But I know it ain't.</p>\n<p>I know it ain't.</p>\n<p>It's as real as anything is these days.</p>\n<p>This coming from an optimist.</p>\n<p>Optimist Prime.</p>\n<p>Tick tock, tick tock...</p>\n<p>⏰ = 💰</p>\n<p>🥺</p>",
