While the other grew up to be a loving person and live a good life.</p>\n<p>And when you asked them, after all these years, why they did what they did, they answered the same way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How was I supposed to turn out with the way I was raised?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm probably getting it all wrong, but I hope you get the idea.</p>\n<p>One learns how to be from their upbringing, another learns how <em>not</em> to be.</p>\n<p>A playbook versus a cautionary tale.</p>\n<p>And believe me, I've seen many things that should have turned my faith, I get it.</p>\n<p>But I feel like not having faith is also somehow not having faith in yourself.</p>\n<p>Somehow, it feels like not believing is like saying, \"I don't believe in myself, anymore.\"</p>\n<p>Do you get me?</p>\n<p>And so, if I were the sort to pour out a little liquor, I'd do so right now.</p>\n<p>On the curb.</p>\n<p>For those who never had faith, or lost it along their way.</p>\n<p>And I hope you join me in pouring one out, rather than be the one we pour for.</p>\n<p>Because I think believing there's something on the other side of forever is just so much easier, it makes so much more sense, than believing there's nothing.</p>\n<p>I just do.</p>\n<p>And after everything I've gone through, everything I have won and lost, everything I have done and not done, how could I believe in anything else?</p>",
