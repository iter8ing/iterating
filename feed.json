In a good way.</p>\n<p>I'm a word nerd. I love words. And if you searched for \"iterating.com\" and found me that way, you're probably a nerd, too, of some sort. Welcome.</p>\n<p>Right now, I've reduced my life to two words: Iterating + Actualization.</p>\n<p>The process that leads to the infinite.</p>\n<p> </p>",
