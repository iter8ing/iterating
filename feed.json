Not sight. Well, I think we had an overhead projector that showed where the keys were, but we couldn't look down at the keys for help.</p>\n<p>We had to train our fingers to know which letters they were responsible for.</p>\n<p>The pinkies had the least responsibility, whereas the index and middle got the brunt.</p>\n<p>Anyways, my point being, perhaps I can type with my eyes closed.</p>\n<p>I can peek at the keys but I know when my fingers strike true.</p>\n<p>This is not an ideal way to write, but I somehow feel more attuned to writing this way.</p>\n<p>My eyes aren't fighting the screen, I'm keeping them mostly closed, just my fingers hunting the board.

And some times, many times, all the time, when you must have something, you are tested.</p>\n<p>So, I suppose, this is some sort of test.</p>\n<p>That's ok. </p>\n<p>And, as I have learned to say, even in nonoptimal conditions, what does this make possible?</p>\n<p>I just realized, for the first time ever, that the \"j\" and \"f\" keys (where your index fingers rest), have a little notch at the bottom. None of the other keys do. I think this is so you know where to orient them. Where to rest them.</p>\n<p>I remember doing that now. When learning to type. I would peel a corner of a sticker for each hand, so I could feel a certain letter. I'd peel the corner up on \"a\" and \"l\" keys so I knew where they were by feel, fi not by sight.</p>\n<p>Have \"f\" and \"j\" always been so distinguished?

I'd like to think I have a bunch of tomorrows coming. Same for my loved ones. Especially those with not a lot of yesterdays racked up. A whole mountain of tomorrows. A starfaring stack of 'em.</p>\n<p>But we simply do not know.</p>\n<p>I don't know.</p>\n<p>I only hope.</p>\n<p>I wish.</p>\n<p>I pray.</p>\n<p>And I know there is so much truth in a life <em>well</em> lived being worth far more than a life <em>long</em> lived. </p>\n<p>But I wish more than anything, as a father, for far more tomorrows for my children than I have had yesterdays. And that someday, they remember their yesterdays as being as sweet as my todays.</p>\n<p>They say only the good die young, and I believe that (to some degree), but that doesn't mean the good can't die old.</p>\n<p><em>Only</em> the good die young.</p>\n<p>Not <em>all</em> of the good.</p>\n<p><em>Some</em> good die old.</p>\n<p>This, like many things, makes me so grateful for the right nows.</p>\n<p>To the well lived, long life.</p>\n<p>And to yesterdays, tomorrows, and everything in between.</p>",
