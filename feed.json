            "content_html": "<p>One of my favorite parts of a good live album or concert is the intro, the monologue, the banter.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the band's playing a little something in the background, while the singer talks about the song coming up.</p>\n<p>When I was young, I didn't like live versions.</p>\n<p>I wanted the album version.</p>\n<p>And most of the time, the live versions weren't as good.</p>\n<p>Poorer sounding.</p>\n<p>Vocally or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, these folks dared changing the lyrics! </p>\n<p>Or turned it acoustic!</p>\n<p>As I grew up, I learned I was wrong.</p>\n<p>I realized how change could be so very magical.</p>\n<p>How much play there was in doing it live.</p>\n<p>How you can go acoustic, ballad, or electric.</p>\n<p>How the same song can feel so different, can play so different, just by changing how you sing it.</p>\n<p>And so, I learned that the true measure of a band was not in the safe studio, it was how they did it live.</p>\n<p>Did they have a story to tell before certain songs.</p>\n<p>Did they evolve it in the time since it's release.</p>\n<p>You hear some artists say they hate to sing their hits because it's just the same crap over and over.</p>\n<p>It becomes something of a catch phrase.</p>\n<p>And I get that, maybe that's why songs do evolve.</p>\n<p>To keep it interesting.</p>\n<p>The best songs change over time. But they stay the same in spirit.</p>\n<p>The best remakes are those that change fast to slow, electric to acoustic. But they stay the same in significance.</p>\n<p>And versa vice.</p>\n<p>I wish sometimes, that there was a piano playing behind me, while I stand on this stage.</p>\n<p>Musing about music.</p>\n<p>Sure, I hit some keys of my own, but they aren't the Mariah Carey or Bruce Hornsby kind, more the clicky-clacky.</p>\n<p>And I just got to tell you, poetry comes in all forms.</p>\n<p>You can read it, you can listen to it, you can see it in motion.</p>\n<p>Live and in living color.</p>\n<p>But most importantly, you can <em>feel</em> it.</p>\n<p>To the bone.</p>\n<p>In your heart.</p>\n<p>For our souls.</p>\n<p>This is for you.</p>\n<p>[Cues up the band.]</p>",
