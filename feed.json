It's such an important position in today's game that you must get the decision right. And then when you do, protect it at all costs. Even if you have to keep competition flowing by bringing in their heir apparents yearly.</p>\n<p>Have the QB feel like he's got to earn the starting role every game, because he does.</p>\n<p>I'm not a one trick pony, though. </p>\n<p>I got other ideas. </p>\n<p>Like how we should make draft combine participants run the 40 yard dash in full gear.
