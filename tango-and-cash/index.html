It took me a long time to learn that.</p><p>Failure is necessarily implied to make accomplishment feel earned.</p><p>If you are guaranteed a win, you will take it for granted.</p><p>Who wants to hit 1.000?</p><p>You think you do, but you really don't.</p><p>But stacking failure on top of another on top of another, that's when things get rough.</p><p>So that's one, to protect those you lead from the spiral failures.</p><p>Sidenote: Work on not being right. Or at least, not feeling some sort of weird mix of vindication ("I told you so") and validation when you caution and warn and then it happens. You can almost see it coming. They can't. You cannot rewind, but memory is a great teacher, and you hope they remember how often you seem to know what you're talking about. Even and especially before it happens.</p><p>I don't rely on people changing. </p><p>I change.</p><p>Either my angle or my position.</p><p>Some mistakes are unforgivable.</p><p>At least by me.</p><p>Protect your loved ones from those.</p><p>And so that's the dance.</p><p>It seems delicate, but upon reflection there's a lot of room on the dance floor.</p><p>There's a lot of space to play.</p><p>But all the fun's at the edges.</p><p>And thus, we dance.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
