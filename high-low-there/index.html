Seems like that kind of heart would break others' hearts.</p><p>You don't appreciate the unlimited power of love until it breaks you or someone close to you.</p><p>The more I wrestle with it, the more I am learning that our point of view, our perspective, might be one of the only truly unique things we have.</p><p>We all own a unique, one of one, perspective. A set of lenses through which we live.</p><p>And as similar as some people may appear, you'll find stark differences the further you zoom in.</p><p>So the challenge, then, should you choose to accept it is:</p><p>Learn from your singular perspective and the infinite of others.</p><p>Why do you (and they) see the world the way you (and they [<em>this is the last time I will do the "and they" thing so just put it after every "you" following</em>]) do?</p><p>How do you define wealth? Is it good or evil? And why?</p><p>How do you define love? Is it good or evil? Do you still believe in it? And why?</p><p>How do you define yourself? Are you good or evil? Do you still believe in you? And why?</p><p>And, perhaps most importantly, how do you define God? Is God benevolent or malevolent? Did you ever, or do you still, believe?
