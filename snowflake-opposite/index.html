Figuratively for most.</p><p>This year has been something. One for the record books.</p><p>Like him or not, the US President has stuffed a decade of events into one year.</p><p>But buckle up, buttercup.</p><p>I think we're looking at another 30 years in the next handful.</p><p>This might not make much sense right now, but it will.</p><p>...</p><p>There are two easy ways to waste time:</p><p>One is to spend it on useless things. Worthless things. Under the Pareto principles, this works out to about 80% of your time spent on a whole bunch of nothing. Or at least, proportionately nothing.</p><p>The other is to try to hold onto it too badly. Trying to capture it and put it into your pocket. You try to get it just right and end up missing the whole darn thing because you were too focused on holding onto it. Because you wanted to savor it.</p><p>So I'm looking forward to 2026.</p><p>I can't believe I'm almost there.</p><p>It's a special year as far as years go, for me.</p><p>But I ain't counting chickens (or crows), yet.</p><p>I am enjoying this last week or so of 2025.</p><p>Putting my chair back, reclining, and just taking it all in.</p><p>My cup runneth over of Coke Zero.</p><p>Ahhhh.</p><p>Carbonation.</p><p>What a life.</p><p>What a run.</p><p>What a world.</p><p>Thank You for letting me play.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
