                <p>When I was a kid, we rooted for the good guys.</p>
<p>The heroes.</p>
<p>The ones who saved people. Beat up villains.</p>
<p>And it was clear. It was clear who the heroes were. And who the villains were.</p>
<p>And today, to me, it's not as clear.</p>
<p>You live long enough, stuff turns upside down.</p>
<p>Who are your heroes?</p>
<p>Who are your villains?</p>
<p>Who is the best person you know? Not talking fame, wealth, or power.</p>
<p>Who has the best heart? Who is bravest? Who do you love the most?</p>
<p>Is it still cool to be good?</p>

                <p>So this is going to be a personal thing. And as a private person, the question then becomes: How personal do I want to get?</p>
<p>Where am I right now?</p>
<p>I'm good. I'm really good. Lucky. Blessed.</p>
<p>It wasn't always this way. Or maybe it was, but I didn't see it.</p>
<p>I see now.</p>
<p>They say youth is wasted on the young. But maybe it really is wisdom wasted on the old.</p>
<p>I sure am wiser than I used to be. But maybe I'm just getting old.</p>
<p>In the 80s, there was this curmudgeon of a wrestler named Terry Funk, a Texas cowboy heel who they would call "Middle-Aged and Crazy!" He used to brand our heroes with an iron from his ranch and swing his fists at ghosts. I used to love to hate him.</p>
<p>But he makes more sense to me, now.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I'm crazy (I'll leave the middle aged part alone), but the things I've done in my life probably only would make sense to few.</p>
<p>I'm being vague purposefully. I don't know how much I want to share. But it's always been personal, never business.</p>
<p>At least with me. Always personal.</p>

<p>Nothing to see here. No one's looking anyway.</p>
<p>I hope. You looking? Blog looker.</p>
<p>These are the ramblings of a guy who has nothing really to say.</p>
<p>Other than: Thank You.</p>
<p>Can I still write? </p>

                <p>I recognize this is just blabbering. These are new digs for me. A new frame. Just wondering what happens when I flip this switch and plug a new thing in.</p>
<p>Will it hold up? Has so far. I like it. </p>
