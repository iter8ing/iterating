                <p>Are your memories treasure?</p>
<p>Or are your visions of the future the treasure?</p>
<p>What about the present?</p>
<p>Is right now considered a treasure?</p>
<p>They all seem pretty valuable.</p>
<p>Treasure hunters are an interesting group.</p>
<p>Chasing futures where they hope to find the valued past right now or somewhat soonish.</p>
<p>Someone's past, found in someone else's present, for yet another someone else's future.</p>
<p>Actually finding the treasure comes with all sorts of drama (like all big moments).</p>
<p>You may not even be able to keep it.</p>
<p>The law, ya know.</p>
<p>But the chase is yours.</p>
<p>They can't take that away.</p>
<p>How big is your fortune?</p>
<p>Is it vaulted in your heart?</p>
<p>Is it in the cloud in your brain?</p>
<p>Or can you touch it with your lips?</p>
<p>Are you the treasure?</p>
<p>Yours or anyone else's?</p>
<p>Somewhere between remembering and imagining is present day.</p>
<p>Vault, earth, cloud.</p>
<p>I'd say carpe diem or some ess, but I hear they cancelled Latin.</p>

                <p>I almost forgot to write again.</p>
<p>Some days just fly by.</p>
<p>Most days do.</p>
<p>As you get older, the seconds, minutes, hours, and days just seem a bit shorter.</p>
<p>Even the microwave timer I set for a few comfortable minutes seems to take me by surprise.</p>
<p><em>Already? I thought I had more time.</em></p>
<p>Kids never want the day to end.</p>
<p>They can spend an eternity in a day and still want it to last a little longer.</p>
<p>My little ones are how I measure time now.</p>
<p>I don't <em>feel</em> old.</p>
<p>I just act it.</p>
<p>Always have.</p>
<p>But when I see how big they're getting, well, do the math.</p>
<p>This is a very wonderful season. In the year. Of my life.</p>
<p>If you don't know by now, I believe time is the truest and most precious currency. </p>
<p>And attention is how we pay.</p>
<p>Are you paying attention to how you spend your time?</p>
<p>Tick tock. </p>
<p>Ever wonder why they call the app that?</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Ever hear the idea that insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result?</p>
<p>This is a <em>mostly</em> true statement.</p>
<p>But there are always exceptions to every rule. Exceptions so few that they prove the rule.</p>
<p>For example, do you know how they split really big rocks?</p>
<p>One person grabs a big hammer.</p>
<p>Said person smashes said hammer on big rock. </p>
<p>It does nothing.</p>
<p>They smash it again in the same spot.</p>
<p>Over and over again.</p>
<p>Expecting it to crack.</p>
<p>It doesn't.</p>
<p>Not right away.</p>
<p>They just keep smacking the rock.</p>
<p>Same spot.</p>
<p>Over and over.</p>
<p>The key is patience. And knowing where and how to strike.</p>
<p>They just keep smashing away.</p>
<p>Then you know what happens?</p>
<p>After a long time, and a lot of reps, the rock just suddenly splits.</p>
<p>A bat ess crazy person probably discovered this.</p>
<p>So, for your consideration:</p>
<p>What are you doing, over and over, expecting a different result?</p>
<p>And are you splitting a rock or swinging at a shadow?</p>
<p>Three feet from gold or digging your own grave?</p>
<p>Find good hammer.</p>
<p>Find good rock. </p>
<p>Find right spot to smash.</p>
<p>Smash rock in right spot.</p>
<p>Over and over.</p>
<p>Nothing happens.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>
<p>Rock splits.</p>
<p>Good work.</p>
<p>Good rock.</p>
<p>Good human.</p>
<p>Next rock...</p>

                <p>I'm just happy to be here.</p>
<p>I know sometimes it's not clear.</p>
<p>That's the old curmudgeon in me.</p>
<p>But I've always been this way.</p>
<p>Right now, all of this, every single ridiculous post, is me reeling from the reality of how a man who plays the long game almost passes, but survives.</p>
<p>Lives to fight another day.</p>
<p>A most fortunate man.</p>
<p>How do you keep thinking and planning the future when you're just enjoying, and grateful for, today?</p>
<p>I tell those closest to me that I'm in my absurd phase.</p>
<p>I'm going for absurd.</p>
<p>It seems like a fun way to play it.</p>
<p>All of this, after all, is the stuff of fairy tales.</p>
<p>Magic and wonder.</p>
<p>I sit in awe of it all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if I'm not the same, the next question is, "Who in the world am I?" Ah! That's the great puzzle!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they lived happily ever after.</p>

                <p>Would you do it again?</p>
<p>I asked this question to the wife of a well-known author, during a lunch we shared with our families. She had told us of all their struggles. And how they were thriving in the good.</p>
<p>Would she do it all again?</p>
<p>She hesitated, deep in thought.</p>
<p>After what felt like a minute, but was only a few long seconds, she said, "Yes, I would, but I wouldn't want to live through all of it again."</p>
<p>My wife and I traveled across the country to meet this couple.</p>
<p>At the time, I was searching for answers. </p>
<p>I suppose I still am.</p>
<p>At the time, it felt like such a win, to be able to poke around the brain of someone you admired.</p>
<p>I don't remember a single thing about what he talked about.</p>
<p>But I remember her answer.</p>

                <p>Drake Maye is the quarterback for the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>[This is my second post about New England Patriot quarterbacks. Weird.]</p>
<p>He said something the other day that I thought relevant.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All the praise when you're successful and all the hatred when things go bad...Don't take criticism from someone you wouldn't take advice from."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It reminds me of a quote from an old friend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If the A-holes are mad at you, you're doing something right."</p>

<p>Today's world gives microphones and megaphones to voices of varying value and values.</p>

<p>Pick your enemies.</p>

                <p>Say what you want about Google, but they are a verb.</p>
<p>And the thing that struck me about their founders was what they said early on. Back before they dominated. When they were just search. And wondering how to monetize it.</p>
<p>As they were just beginning, as they were just gaining traction, they said something really interesting.</p>
<p>They said: The later you discover us, the better.</p>
<p>Meaning, they wanted people to find out about Google later. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the team believed the later you found them, the better they would be. Their first impression would be more impressive.</p>
<p>In a world where most people want it and they want it now, there are still some of us who are like yeah, I got work to do, find me later.</p>
<p>Find me later.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I'd be better, but the later you find me, the better.</p>
