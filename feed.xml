                <p>Remember in those Saturday morning Kung Fu movies, the old guy?</p>
<p>Long, silvery hair, fu manchu, could float on clouds and ride lightning bolts.</p>
<p>Never the main character, just the Grandmaster the star needs to meet to beat the main bad guy.</p>
<p>A little mean. A little eccentric. A little ethereal.</p>
<p>There's marketing that says everyone wants to be the hero, but you get paid the most for being the mentor. The guide. Ain't that grand?</p>
<p>If you're into that.</p>
<p>Me? I like riding lightning bolts.</p>

                <p>You know, professional fighters and wrestlers are lucky.</p>
<p>They get entrance songs. </p>
<p>I suppose baseball players get walk-up music. And relief pitchers get a song.</p>
<p>But Bill in accounting doesn't. </p>
<p>Or Fred in legal.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>Maybe they should.</p>
<p>All of that to say, what's your entrance song?</p>
<p>What you rocking to the ring or cage?</p>
<p>I've always been partial to Monster Magnet's "Space Lord" -- but then there's Hendrix.</p>
<p>High quality problem, picking out your entrance song.</p>
<p>Too many to choose from.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>So people remember people by a singular image.</p>
<p>Like for the current president of the United States. He will be remembered for this current phase. </p>
<p>It won't be real estate mogul. It won't be reality TV star.</p>
<p>It'll be him old. Mr. President. That's his singular photo op.</p>
<p>It's like Yoda. Or Mr. Miyagi.</p>
<p>We don't remember them young, however accomplished they were then. They're forever the older versions. Their singular image.</p>
<p>Of course it works for younger people, too. Some we remember for their youth.</p>
<p>Often those taken too soon.</p>
<p>And so what I'm getting at is, I'm working on my singular image thing.</p>
<p>And I want it to be a long ways away.</p>
<p>I don't want it to be 20 year old me. Or 40. Or 50. Maybe 60. Maybe 70.</p>
<p>God willing.</p>
<p>Anyways, that's my theory.</p>
<p>What's the picture people will remember you by? You then? You now? Or you later?</p>

<p>Years. </p>
<p>They only live a few weeks above water and flying around. As the dragonflies we know and love.</p>
<p>Imagine that. You spend your whole life underwater.</p>
<p>Thinking that is the whole world.</p>
<p>Then, in your golden years, you emerge. In a whole new world.</p>
<p>As a whole new creation.</p>

                <p>Been thinking a lot about time.</p>
<p>Time as currency.</p>
<p>Time as wealth.</p>
<p>And how the richest of us have decades, even a century, ahead of us.</p>
<p>And how we punish people with prison terms measured in time. How we punish by taking their time away. It's the ultimate penalty. Taking away time.</p>
<p>And how so many of us waste our time.</p>
<p>Like self-imposed prison sentences.</p>
<p>And I wrestle with this, as a man who believes in playing the long game.</p>
<p>Patience while enjoying the moment. Delaying gratification but finding it gratifying to do so. Tapping infinity in a second. Over and over.</p>

<p>The heroes.</p>
<p>The ones who saved people. Beat up villains.</p>
<p>And it was clear. It was clear who the heroes were. And who the villains were.</p>
<p>And today, to me, it's not as clear.</p>
<p>You live long enough, stuff turns upside down.</p>
<p>Who are your heroes?</p>
<p>Who are your villains?</p>
<p>Who is the best person you know? Not talking fame, wealth, or power.</p>
<p>Who has the best heart? Who is bravest? Who do you love the most?</p>
<p>Is it still cool to be good?</p>
<p>And would anyone, anyone in the world, say the best person they know is you?</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>So this is going to be a personal thing. And as a private person, the question then becomes: How personal do I want to get?</p>
<p>Where am I right now?</p>
<p>I'm good. I'm really good. Lucky. Blessed.</p>
<p>It wasn't always this way. Or maybe it was, but I didn't see it.</p>
<p>I see now.</p>
<p>They say youth is wasted on the young. But maybe it really is wisdom wasted on the old.</p>
<p>I sure am wiser than I used to be. But maybe I'm just getting old.</p>
<p>In the 80s, there was this curmudgeon of a wrestler named Terry Funk, a Texas cowboy heel who they would call "Middle-Aged and Crazy!" He used to brand our heroes with an iron from his ranch and swing his fists at ghosts. I used to love to hate him.</p>
<p>But he makes more sense to me, now.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I'm crazy (I'll leave the middle-aged part alone), but the things I've done in my life probably only would make sense to few.</p>
<p>I'm being vague purposefully. I don't know how much I want to share. But it's always been personal, never business.</p>
<p>At least with me. Always personal.</p>
