                <p>You ever stick to something, just because you wanted to see how it ends?</p>
<p>Be it a book, a movie, a tv show, a job?</p>
<p>Why do we do that?</p>
<p>Some sort of closure is needed. </p>
<p>Even if you know it'll disappoint.</p>
<p>I'd like to think that wisdom is in knowing what to finish and what to just stop.</p>
<p>What is worth finishing?</p>
<p>What is worth stopping?</p>

                <p>Would you do it again?</p>
<p>I asked this question to the wife of a well-known author, during a lunch we shared with our families. She had told us of all their struggles. And how they were thriving in the good.</p>
<p>Would she do it all again?</p>
<p>She hesitated, deep in thought.</p>
<p>After what felt like a minute, but was only a few long seconds, she said, "Yes, I would, but I wouldn't want to live through all of it again."</p>
<p>My wife and I traveled across the country to meet this couple.</p>
<p>At the time, I was searching for answers. </p>
<p>I suppose I still am.</p>
<p>At the time, it felt like such a win, to be able to poke around the brain of someone you admired.</p>
<p>I don't remember a single thing about what he talked about.</p>
<p>But I remember her answer.</p>

                <p>Drake Maye is the quarterback for the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>[This is my second post about New England Patriot quarterbacks. Weird.]</p>
<p>He said something the other day that I thought relevant.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All the praise when you're successful and all the hatred when things go bad...Don't take criticism from someone you wouldn't take advice from."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It reminds me of a quote from an old friend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If the A-holes are mad at you, you're doing something right."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today's world gives microphones and megaphones to voices of varying value and values.</p>
<p>Pick your mentors.</p>
<p>Pick your enemies.</p>
<p>May they never cross.</p>

                <p>Say what you want about Google, but they are a verb.</p>
<p>And the thing that struck me about their founders was what they said early on. Back before they dominated. When they were just search. And wondering how to monetize it.</p>
<p>As they were just beginning, as they were just gaining traction, they said something really interesting.</p>
<p>They said: The later you discover us, the better.</p>
<p>Meaning, they wanted people to find out about Google later. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the team believed the later you found them, the better they would be. Their first impression would be more impressive.</p>
<p>In a world where most people want it and they want it now, there are still some of us who are like yeah, I got work to do, find me later.</p>
<p>Find me later.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I'd be better, but the later you find me, the better.</p>
<p>I got so much work to do.</p>
<p>But I'm trying. I'm trying real hard, Ringo.</p>

<p>Remember those days when we'd have to knock the side of the television to get it to work?</p>
<p>Technology is always improving, but you can't thump it anymore.</p>
<p>It's unthumpable.</p>
<p>And there are times when it just don't make sense. When the urge to thump rises.</p>
<p>And you got to adjust, you gotta tinker. I would say iterate, but yeah, that's not the right word.</p>
<p>Clouds and locals. </p>
<p>Syncs and backups.</p>
<p>Fixed this issue, it seems, but it really wasn't an issue.</p>
<p>Just redundancy.</p>
<p>A Plan B.</p>

<p>Ability scores. Hit points. Levels. Classes. Alignment. Weapons. Armor. Magic items.</p>
<p>Why save that sweet nectar for the fictional?</p>
<p>So that's what I would encourage you to do today.</p>
<p>Create your own character sheet. For you.</p>
<p>And keep updating it, iterating(!) it, as you go through this campaign called life.</p>
<p>To leveling up, forever.</p>

                <p>Every decision you have ever made, good or bad, has put you right here. </p>
<p>To where you are right now.</p>
<p>If you're happy with where you are right now, it's hard to have regrets.</p>
<p>Every downturn led to an up, every up to a down. Sometimes they stack.</p>
<p>It's the downturn stacks you must avoid. Loss on loss on loss.</p>
<p>Upturn stacks are sacred. Gain on gain on gain.</p>
<p>Exponential works both ways.</p>
<p>But they happen. For want of nails or unicorns.</p>
<p>We've all been through it. If you haven't yet, you will.</p>
<p>And if you really think about it, every gain and every loss has also provided an accompanying loss and gain as well.</p>
<p>Yin and yang. Bad in good. Good in bad.</p>
<p>The real questions are:</p>
<p>What do we lose in gain?</p>
<p>And what do we gain in loss?</p>
<p>Hope you find your nail, even if you have to step on it.</p>

                <p>One thing they don't tell you about life is that if you live long enough you go through different versions of yourself.</p>
<p>The first version is your childhood. Large and small iterations as you turn older. Teen. Young adult. Professional. Parent. Grandparent. Retired. Professional amateur. Etc.</p>
<p>The way I figure it, I'm at version 5.0.</p>
<p>I'm not saying it's better than previous versions (yes, I am), but there's things that have been refined, things removed, and things added.</p>
<p>Like all major updates.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of hours upping my wisdom score and a lot less time in the weight room (not many centenarians walking around at 220 pounds). More long walks (for me).</p>
<p>Oh, and there's the fact that version 4.something almost died.</p>
<p>There's that, too.</p>
<p>Anyways, that's what I'll leave you with.</p>
<p>This idea that we're always changing.</p>
<p>I don't think people tell people this enough.</p>
<p>You don't stay the exact same your whole life. </p>
<p>There are different phases. Seasons. Versions.</p>
<p>You just keep iterating.</p>
<p>Iterating.</p>
<p>That's kind of the whole thing we're doing, right?</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Mental note.</p>
<p>To versions past, present and future.</p>
