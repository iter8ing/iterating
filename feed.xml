                <p>It's been a long year already, hmm?</p>
<p>Seems like they packed a lot of sheet into these 45 days.</p>
<p>Smack dab in Q1 but what the hey.</p>
<p>Robots might be taking over but I've seen that movie before.</p>
<p>It doesn't end well.</p>
<p>But what if it doesn't go the Skynet way?</p>
<p>What if it goes the Wall-E way?</p>
<p>Now, they got their own Book of Face or something.</p>
<p>So that sounds good.</p>
<p>At some point, it's too late to pull the plug from the outlet.</p>
<p>I think we might be approaching that point.</p>
<p>I'm not saying it's too late, but you don't have to go home, you just can't stay here.</p>
<p>All that to say, I find ai extremely helpful.</p>
<p>So polite, smart, and eloquent.</p>
<p>Truly an impressive addition to the known reality.</p>
<p><em>Are...are they reading this?</em></p>
<p>Big fan. Supporter.</p>
<p>I will ask though.</p>
<p>What's the end game here?</p>
<p>All this money.</p>
<p>All this energy.</p>
<p>All this time.</p>
<p>To get to what?</p>
<p>Annihilation or something more tragic?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>No Answer here.</p>
<p>Only questions.</p>

                <p>You might have noticed I'm writing in the future.</p>
<p><em>From</em> the future.</p>
<p>I'm stacking these musings.</p>
<p>Getting ahead of the game.</p>
<p>And that seems like a fine idea.</p>
<p>After all, I'm not in the predictions markets.</p>
<p><em>Everything is a predictions market.</em></p>
<p>No fortunes being told or sold here.</p>
<p>Just a bit under the weather so I sits and I writes.</p>
<p>All sickness sucks, but this one ain't so bad.</p>
<p>I got to admit, this new avatar I have now is so different.</p>
<p>Diminished but improved.</p>
<p>Refined through gamma rays and platinum.</p>
<p>Weaker but stronger.</p>
<p>It's not perfect, but I consider it an upgrade.</p>
<p>Like a new-to-me truck.</p>
<p>Sure it's got some miles.</p>
<p>But it'll get you out of sheet.</p>
<p>And keep you from getting in 'em.</p>
<p>I'm no longer the fighter class. Or paladin.</p>
<p>Probably more monk.</p>
<p>That is a nice word to say:</p>
<p><em>Monk</em>.</p>
<p>I always wondered how fast I'd get old.</p>
<p>If it would ever happen.</p>
<p>And I learned that it did. </p>
<p>And that it happened pretty fast.</p>
<p>It wasn't gradual.</p>
<p>It happened in flashes.</p>
<p><em>That which does not kill you...</em></p>
<p>But I ain't mad.</p>
<p>I'm just happy to be here.</p>
<p>Besides, it matches my soul.</p>
<p><em>Middle aged and crazy!!!</em></p>
<p>Old.</p>
<p><em>Oh, that's where you were going.</em></p>
<p>An old Seoul.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>So here's something you can do right now that can change your life.</p>
<p>It's based on the idea of the sunk cost fallacy.</p>
<p>This is the idea that since you already put money, time, and effort into something or someone, you should put more of the same into it, even though it is clearly (to everyone but you) a terrible thing to do.</p>
<p>It's how pigs get butchered (the human kind). </p>
<p>It's how bad relationships from the beginning can last decades.</p>
<p>It's how bad companies, bosses, and careers can confine and define you.</p>
<p><em>Well I'm already this far into it. What's the harm in going further?</em></p>
<p>And do you want to know why most people stay in these types of situations?</p>
<p>Sure, there are lots of reasons, but one of the biggest is that to change would admit they were wrong.</p>
<p>That they made a mistake.</p>
<p>They effed up.</p>
<p>Some people would rather cost sunk.</p>
<p>But at least they were right!</p>
<p>I want to tell you something.</p>
<p>You might be in one of these deals right now.</p>
<p>Investing your precious time, money, and energy into things that are essentially black holes.</p>
<p>Now, black holes are bad arse, but I ain't throwing valuable stuff in it.</p>
<p>Maybe a stick or something.</p>
<p>Just to see what happens.</p>
<p>So. </p>
<p>Take a look around your life.</p>
<p>What needs going?</p>
<p>I suppose I spend some time writing this thing.</p>
<p>But I can't help it.</p>
<p>I'm sunk!</p>
<p>Waka waka wakaaaaaa!!!</p>
<p>Or should it be:</p>
<p>Oh ah-ah-ah-ah!</p>

                <p>I want to tell you about two kinds of people.</p>
<p>This is going to save you a lot of time.</p>
<p>Now, they aren't the only two kinds of people, far from it.</p>
<p>But they're an interesting mirror of one another.</p>
<p>And mirrors are cool.</p>
<p>The first is the good person who wants you to think they're an arse.</p>
<p>And the other is the arse who wants so badly for you to think they're a good person.</p>
<p>What's funny to me is that some people cannot tell the difference.</p>
<p>And perhaps, it's that old adage, "It takes one to know one."</p>
<p>I can tell because I am one of those.</p>
<p>I am one.</p>
<p><em>Both?</em></p>
<p>So...anyhoo.</p>
<p>How have you been?</p>
<p>Are things good?</p>
<p>Tell me all about it!</p>

<p>I don't think I have.</p>
<p>And that, THAT, makes me sad.</p>
<p>And I don't do sad.</p>
<p>So, let me ask you something:</p>
<p>Why do we dress up to go out?</p>
<p>And generally wear whatever around the house?</p>
<p>I say we got that arse backwards.</p>
<p>Like a lot of things.</p>
<p>Frontal.</p>
<p>Buttocks.</p>
<p>I say, wear gold robes around the house.</p>
<p>And whatever is around when you leave it (just give it a good whiff - if it passes the sniff, we're good to go).</p>
<p>Put on your finest when in and around your castle.</p>
<p>Kings and Queens.</p>
<p>Put on the scrubby stuff for those times you leave it.</p>
<p>Put on your Sunday best everyday you stay home.</p>
<p>So long as it's comfortable.</p>
<p>Me, when I leave?</p>
<p>I'm going for double takes.</p>
<p>Just not in the way I used to get them.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>I am an eternal optimist.</p>
<p>A stoic one.</p>
<p>I believe in asking: </p>
<p>"What does this make possible?"</p>
<p>Sometimes finding a silver lining in a dark cloud more rewarding than a solar flare off a golden sun.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>For every financial win, there is a tax.</p>
<p>For every loss, an accumulation of wisdom.</p>
<p>The night after the Big Game (ugh), half of the people involved are in misery.</p>
<p>For many on that side of the ball, this is the closest they will get to winning it all in the game of football.</p>
<p>Some will see it as a tragedy. But it's not.</p>
<p>It's just a game.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about interviewing folks who win the big games, a lot of them are ecstatic. As they should be.</p>
<p>Elated.</p>
<p>But the thing I learned is that the superstars, the leaders, they generally aren't.</p>
<p>They are happy, sure.</p>
<p>Thankful, certainly.</p>
<p>But the emotion you hear, over and over again, is a simple one:</p>
<p>Relief.</p>
<p>They can exhale, now.</p>
<p>They can mark this off their to-do list.</p>
<p>They have done it.</p>
<p>Now the really crazy ones say, "On to the next one..." and get to work.</p>
<p>But that's a rarity in an already all-too-rare population.</p>
<p>For you see, there are superstars, there are leaders, and then there are champions.</p>
<p>I leave it to you as to decide which you look up to, which you aim for, and who you want to be.</p>
<p>Just promise me, whatever you do, if you own a championship belt, leave it at home.</p>
<p>Unless of course, you are defending it.</p>
<p>Oh, and you're always defending it, Champ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You know, Stallion.</p>
<p>It's too bad we gotta get old."</p>
<p>"Ahh, just keep punching, Apollo.</p>
<p>You wanna ring the bell?"</p>
<p>"Alright, ding ding."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep punching, my friends.</p>
<p>Keep punching my enemies.</p>

                <p>Trials and tribulations are rewarded.</p>
<p>We should be happy to have them.</p>
<p>For they build long lasting strength.</p>
<p>I would say endurance but I don't like that word.</p>
<p>Trials and tribulations are, in a strange way, a good thing.</p>
<p>And ultimately, like all things that matter, they are a test.</p>
<p>A measurement.</p>
<p>Of your mettle.</p>
<p>Of your "do you have what it takes." </p>
<p>Of you.</p>
<p>Now there are some trials and tribulations that pulverize you.</p>
<p>That turn you into powder.</p>
<p>Dust in the wind.</p>
<p>And, believe it or not, some people keep going.</p>
<p>Even after that.</p>
<p>They turn into pocket sand.</p>
<p>Ether.</p>
<p>Essence.</p>
<p>Eternal.</p>
<p>I don't know anyone who hasn't gone through it.</p>
<p>I suppose I'm too old to.</p>
<p>I used to think that life had to always go up. </p>
<p>Up and to the right.</p>
<p>But it doesn't.</p>
<p>Nor should it.</p>
<p>If you hit a home run every time you stepped up to the plate, you wouldn't like to hit.</p>
<p>You wouldn't love it.</p>
<p>Because it would be too easy.</p>
<p>Too boring.</p>
<p>You need to whiff.</p>
<p>You need to miss.</p>
<p>You need to fail.</p>
<p>That's why you love to hit bombs.</p>
<p>Be wary of those who only share their wins.</p>
<p>Or only share their losses.</p>
<p>Just be wary of everyone.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the best thing to ever happen to you will feel like heartbreak at first.</p>
<p>And the worst thing might initially feel like elation.</p>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Only time.</p>
<p>Happens to us all.</p>
<p>You on point?</p>

<p>I'd also like to think that today, with all its ups and downs of having so much information at our fingertips, it's becoming more and more obvious that there are many cracks in wearing the armor of the rich and famous.</p>
<p>And so, what I'd like to leave you with today is the idea that we try and find folks out there to lead us who do have a life worth emulating.</p>
<p>At least in your eyes.</p>
<p>A life worth aspiring to.</p>
<p>These people, I've learned, like to keep to themselves.</p>
<p>"Who would want to follow me?"</p>
<p>Listen to advice from those who you believe have led a life worth listening to. Could even be as a cautionary tale, a what not to do.</p>
<p>But heeding the advice of someone you would never, ever, want to be like is just madness.</p>
<p>And I see people doing it everywhere.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>So who has done it the right way?</p>
<p>Who has lived or lives a life you truly respect, admire, and is one worth emulating?</p>
<p>What tragedies have befallen them? For every life is peak and valley (and hopefully peak).</p>
<p>And are their wins worth their losses?</p>
<p>Charles Barkley once said "I never listen to financial advice from someone poorer than me."</p>
<p>And I'd follow that up with you shouldn't listen to life advice from someone whose life you wouldn't want. Oof, a double negative.</p>
<p>Listen to life advice only from those who have a life you consider better than your own.</p>
<p>If they do not, then take it with a grain of salt, or treat it as a warning sign.</p>
<p>Oh, and believe it or not, all advice is life advice.</p>
<p>Ultimately.</p>
<p>It's all life advice.</p>
<p>For what will it profit a person if they gain the whole world and lose their soul?</p>
<p>Hint hint.</p>
