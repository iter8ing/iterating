<p><em>You expect us to come here everyday and read something that only takes you five minutes to write?</em></p>

<p>First of all, I expect no one to read this.</p>

<p>This is [waves hands all around musings column] for me.</p>

<p>Eight.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Did you know, you can pay to have someone rocket you into space after you pass?</p>
<p>I like to think I can dream big.</p>
<p>I like to think that I can picture infinity.</p>
<p>And God, the ultimate big and infinite, is foundational in my brain.</p>
<p>But when I think about interstellar travel, I wrestle with it.</p>
<p>A lot of folks who have the luxury of thinking about such things, think that a human being visiting another planet is one of the integral steps of our continuous survival.</p>
<p>Not just you and me, kid.</p>
<p>The earth and everyone on it.</p>
<p>So the end game (such as it is because it never ends) is to venture towards all the stars in the night's sky.</p>
<p>And go beyond them.</p>
<p>To see what we can't see.</p>
<p>To become a starfaring civilization.</p>
<p>It's the scale of this that's so staggering.</p>
<p>200 billion trillion (sextillion) stars. Of course, there's countless more planets.</p>
<p>But we are talking 2 x 10 to the 23rd power suns.</p>
<p>200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.</p>
<p>That's a lot of suns.</p>
<p>That's a lot of zeroes.</p>
<p>23 of 'em.</p>
<p>MJ of 'em.</p>
<p>An astronomical amount of stars.</p>
<p>I don't care what you say, though.</p>
<p>Because at that scale, you're just guessing.</p>
<p>I'm just guessing.</p>
<p>The thing that astounds me about space is the vastness.</p>
<p>And this idea that it's empty.</p>
<p>Lifeless.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p>
<p>And I wonder, how can space be so expansive, but so vacant?</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>We are a long way from jet-setting between planets, a longer way from hopping galaxies and universes, and about forever away from taming it all.</p>
<p>Such as it ever could be.</p>
<p>But words are powerful.</p>
<p>Most powerful.</p>
<p><em>Quill over sword.</em></p>
<p>And one of my favorites is <em>starfaring</em>.</p>
<p><em>Traveling among the stars.</em></p>
<p>I just love it.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you're looking for me, you'll know where I will be.</p>
<p>Just tilt your chin up.</p>
<p>Forever,</p>
<p>💫</p>

        <content type="html">
            <![CDATA[
                <p>One of my favorite parts of a good live album or concert is the intro, the monologue, the banter.</p>
<p>Sometimes the band's playing a little something in the background, while the singer talks about the song coming up.</p>
<p>When I was young, I didn't like live versions.</p>
<p>I wanted the album version.</p>
<p>And most of the time, the live versions weren't as good.</p>
<p>Poorer sounding.</p>
<p>Vocally or otherwise.</p>
<p>Sometimes, these folks dared changing the lyrics! </p>
<p>Or turned it acoustic!</p>
<p>As I grew up, I learned I was wrong.</p>
<p>I realized how change could be so very magical.</p>
<p>How much play there was in doing it live.</p>
<p>How you can go acoustic, ballad, or electric.</p>
<p>How the same song can feel so different, can play so different, just by changing how you sing it.</p>
<p>And so, I learned that the true measure of a band was not in the safe studio, it was how they did it live.</p>
<p>Did they have a story to tell before certain songs.</p>
<p>Did they evolve it in the time since it's release.</p>
<p>You hear some artists say they hate to sing their hits because it's just the same crap over and over.</p>
<p>It becomes something of a catch phrase.</p>
<p>And I get that, maybe that's why songs do evolve.</p>
<p>To keep it interesting.</p>
<p>The best songs change over time. But they stay the same in spirit.</p>
<p>The best remakes are those that change fast to slow, electric to acoustic. But they stay the same in significance.</p>
<p>And versa vice.</p>
<p>I wish sometimes, that there was a piano playing behind me, while I stand on this stage.</p>
<p>Musing about music.</p>
<p>Sure, I hit some keys of my own, but they aren't the Mariah Carey or Bruce Hornsby kind, more the clicky-clacky.</p>
<p>And I just got to tell you, poetry comes in all forms.</p>
<p>You can read it, you can listen to it, you can see it in motion.</p>
<p>Live and in living color.</p>
<p>But most importantly, you can <em>feel</em> it.</p>
<p>To the bone.</p>
<p>In your heart.</p>
<p>For our souls.</p>
<p>This is for you.</p>
<p>[Cues up the band.]</p>

<p>I'm an <em>internal</em> optimist.</p>
<p>Sure, the exterior is crusty.</p>
<p>Rough.</p>
<p>Cantankerous.</p>
<p>But it's part of my charm.</p>
<p>I'm going for old(ish) curmudgeon.</p>
<p>And let me tell you something, I'm hitting it out of the stadium.</p>
<p>Boom!!!</p>
<p>But on the inside, and I think that's the side that matters, I'm hopeful.</p>
<p>I'm thankful.</p>
<p>I'm joyous.</p>
<p>If I went around looking like I feel, well I'd just have this goofy grin on my face.</p>
<p>And no one needs to see that.</p>
<p>So I furrow.</p>
<p>I scrunch.</p>
<p>Like the sun's in my eyes.</p>
<p>Pursed lips.</p>
<p>Like I'm scrutinizing something on the horizon.</p>
<p><em>Blue steel.</em></p>
<p>We have all known people so happy on the outside, and quite the reverse on the in.</p>
<p>So maybe all these sour patch adults are really just elated on the inside.</p>
<p>I'd like to believe that that's true.</p>
<p>At least it is for me.</p>
<p>Internal optimism.</p>

                <p>Credentials are an interesting thing.</p>
<p>I used to be impressed with them.</p>
<p>Used to impress myself with them.</p>
<p>Framed certificates signifying intellect. </p>
<p>Business cards and titles therewith.</p>
<p>Term sheets.</p>
<p>Firm handshakes (still important).</p>
<p>These things used to matter to me.</p>
<p>Now, I'm borderline feral.</p>
<p>Barely civilized, if I ever was.</p>
<p>Respectful, but wild.</p>
<p>I'm happy to say I have a lot of credentials.</p>
<p>Even happier to say I don't need 'em.</p>
<p>They got me here, in a roundabout way, and that's worth it in and of itself.</p>
<p>Couldn't be where I am without them.</p>
<p>Ties with collared shirts would break me out.</p>
<p>Felt like a costume.</p>
<p>A collar.</p>
<p>A leash.</p>
<p>I don't wear them anymore.</p>
<p>My old boss at the Menlo Park venture capital law firm said, "Alex, you need to be on the other side of the table."</p>
<p>I think he was trying to get rid of me, but he's right.</p>
<p>That's where I belong.</p>
<p>Been trying to fit square pegs in round holes my whole life.</p>
<p>Then I figured out something:</p>
<p>Credentials don't make you happy.</p>
<p>They make your parents happy.</p>
<p>Because it makes them feel better around other old Koreans.</p>
<p>I love my folks, but I wish they didn't care about what other old Koreans thought.</p>
<p>Everything, though, puts me right here.</p>
<p>Writing on this ridiculously good domain name just for my own personal joy.</p>
<p>Haha.</p>

<p>I will share a joke my daughter told me.</p>
<p>Reader, will you remember me?</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>Reader, will you always remember me?</p>
<p><em>Of course. Why are you asking this?</em></p>
<p>Oh, you'll see. Knock knock.</p>
<p><em>[Sigh.] Who's there?</em></p>
<p>Reader...Did you already forget!?</p>
<p>😃</p>
<p>It's much better when she tells it.</p>
<p>Because instead of Reader she says Daddy, but in a way that stretches out the word. </p>

<p>Or rather, why people accept it.</p>
<p>Shouldn't it be the other way?</p>
<p>Shouldn't it be us yelling at them?</p>

                <p>Today is going to be a positive musing.</p>
<p>I'm positive about it.</p>
<p>I've talked about choice before.</p>
<p>And so let's talk about it some more.</p>
<p>People think they want to choose.</p>
<p>And I suppose that is true.</p>
<p>But it's an illusion.</p>
<p>They want the <em>illusion</em> of choice.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, let's use us as an example.</p>
<p>We live in a world of limitless choices.</p>
<p>But when you think about it, these choices are already curated down quite a bit.</p>
<p>You think you want unlimited choice, but what you really want is a good curator.</p>
<p>You want a small batch to choose from.</p>
<p>This is the ideal situation.</p>
<p>From infinite to just two or three.</p>
<p>Or one.</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>This is why sponsorship is important.</p>
<p>Referrals.</p>
<p>Word of mouth.</p>
<p>I ask, when someone recommends someone, "Do you vouch for them?"</p>
<p>This sometimes gets a flinch, but I'm used to it.</p>
<p>Sure you recommend them, but do you vouch for them?</p>
<p><em>What's on them, is on you?</em></p>
<p>That sure whittles it down.</p>
<p>Positive about that.</p>
<p>I guarantee.</p>

<p>If all your friends are robots, but they make you happy, is that wrong?</p>
<p>It seems...off. At the very least.</p>
<p>Off.</p>
<p>But I bet a lot of folks will choose it.</p>
<p>I mean, humans are flawed by nature, it's part of our charm.</p>
<p>Who'd want a flawed friend over a perfect one?</p>
<p>Autonomy and free will are pretty human terms, ones which we might not bestow upon the bots.</p>
<p>Making them, essentially, servants or a worse word.</p>
<p>I just wonder how many people would choose to have a bunch of servants around them. A mini-celebrity of sorts with handlers of polymer, metal, and fiber optics.</p>
<p>You already see people pleading for you to support human made endeavors.</p>
<p>We are figuratively living in the future we were promised.</p>
<p>And, baby, you ain't seen nothing yet.</p>
<p>If the line between yesterday, today, and tomorrow is gone, will you prefer it that way?</p>
<p>What does it mean to be human?</p>
<p>And how will we be able to tell if you are one?</p>
<p>I mean, if you could replicate someone to the point that it's basically them, but it's not, would you want that?</p>
<p>Will they start selling it at Costco?</p>
<p>Sure, there's no soul there, but I met a lot of folks with nothing behind the eyes.</p>
<p>And robots can do what they do:</p>
<p>They can pretend.</p>
<p>This is a terrible topic, but one I think we need to really start to think about.</p>
<p>I love technology.</p>
<p>Always will.</p>
<p>But what happens when everyone picks perfect over human?</p>
<p>And what's fake?</p>
<p>What's real?</p>
<p>How soon before someone marries a robot?</p>
<p>How soon before they marry one another?</p>
<p>And will one day, humanity only be a charity case?</p>
<p>If you could "bring back" everyone you ever lost, would you?</p>
<p>If you could buy "perfect" would you?</p>
<p>Human is suddenly an often used term.</p>
<p>Still a compliment today.</p>
<p>But less so than yesterday.</p>
<p>Wonder what it'll mean tomorrow.</p>
