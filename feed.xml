                <p>Would you rather:</p>
<p>Live half a life but live to 100?</p>
<p>Or live twice a life but only to 50?</p>
<p>I used to think the latter. </p>
<p>Not even close.</p>
<p>This was before I started a family.</p>
<p>Before I had a little girl.</p>
<p>When I was at my sickest, my wife wanted me to write something for my daughter.</p>
<p>When we all weren't sure if I'd make it.</p>
<p>And, if you know anything about me, you should know I wrote a book for my wife and son. But this was all before my little girl came into the world.</p>
<p>And when you have a son, well that is a dream come true.</p>
<p>That boy is our spirit.</p>
<p>But then my daughter appears.</p>
<p>And she is our soul.</p>
<p>She completes our family.</p>
<p>I know now why fathers of daughters wear "Girl Dad" branding.</p>
<p>And so I tried to write something for her.</p>
<p>Just for her.</p>
<p>Many times.</p>
<p>A goodbye note.</p>
<p>A letter of love from her dad.</p>
<p>But I never could.</p>
<p>It was just too much.</p>
<p>I pray in the end, if God agrees, that if I can live half a life so that I can live to 100, or at least to watch her grow up, it's a fine deal.</p>
<p>No question about it.</p>
<p>To watch them all grow.</p>
<p>To see them each iterating to their own actualization.</p>
<p>It's not about me anymore, and I suppose it never has been.</p>
<p>My letter to my daughter will be in the form of my presence.</p>
<p>I will <em>be</em> my letter.</p>
<p>She thinks I have left her when I go to a different floor of our home.</p>
<p>This is the extent of how I wish she defines abandonment.</p>
<p>May she never know that word truly.</p>
<p>Just that I'm on a different floor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the best girl,</p>
<p>Daddy loves you so much I cannot put it into words.</p>
<p>I don't have them.</p>
<p>I will just have to show you.</p>
<p>For the rest of my life.</p>
<p>And ever after.</p>
<p>The Luckiest Father,</p>
<p>Yours </p>
</blockquote>
<p>PS: I am just downstairs, Amlette. Typing my musings column. Be right up, love.</p>

                <p>Who are you?</p>
<p>I mean that in the most literal way.</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>And how do you define yourself?</p>
<p>Most people would answer the question like I'm asking what their name is.</p>
<p>And I love names.</p>
<p>But what I am asking is more:</p>
<p>What do you represent?</p>
<p>How do you wish to be defined?</p>
<p>What should I call you?</p>
<p>My umma when I was still in her womb had a dream that her baby to be was all growns up and dressed in a black flowing robe. This convinced her I was destined to be a judge.</p>
<p>And well, I guess I am.</p>
<p>Got a law degree (in a black robe!).</p>
<p>Got a law license (in a suit - 🕴- yuck &lt;-- but he's levitating!).</p>
<p>Got black on right now (no robes though).</p>
<p>Got a gavel or two.</p>
<p>I call myself the "Supreme Court" but only in my house.</p>
<p>Only to my kids.</p>
<p>But we all get a good laugh.</p>
<p>I should buy a black robe though. </p>
<p>I think grandmasters wear those.</p>
<p>Would fit my style.</p>
<p>So sayeth, The Supreme Court!</p>
<p>⚖</p>
<p><em>Judge: A person able or qualified to give an opinion on something.</em></p>
<p>Umma, you are right, I always been judge!!!</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>There was a book I read years ago.</p>
<p>I cannot remember the name of the book or its author.</p>
<p>A shame.</p>
<p>But I remember it's beginning/preface/intro.</p>
<p>Whatever you call it.</p>
<p>There's a little shack in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>And this knock at the door.</p>
<p>And the old man inside shouts, "What do you want?"</p>
<p>And the knocker politely says, "Sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for the master."</p>
<p>And the old man retorts, "There is no master here. Go away."</p>
<p>It's written more eloquently and evocatively than that.</p>
<p>But the idea always stuck with me.</p>
<p>How the old man didn't want to open the door.</p>
<p>How the knocker was searching for wisdom.</p>
<p>How the old man didn't want to give it.</p>
<p>And it's sort of a trope.</p>
<p>Some wisdom is hard won.</p>
<p>And those who have won it wear it like battle scars.</p>
<p>Either they share it proudly or hide it securely.</p>
<p>And those who seek it have to keep trying.</p>
<p>The old man is a good one, but he's been burned before.</p>
<p>Many, many times.</p>
<p>There's a lot of old masters hanging it up, I think.</p>
<p>Never to be seen again.</p>
<p>I understand why.</p>
<p>But it's a little sad.</p>
<p>So much left to give.</p>
<p>Nothing left to want to.</p>
<p>Now go away.</p>
<p>No old man here.</p>
<p>Come back tomorrow.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>I don't think we listen to music enough.</p>
<p>At least, I don't.</p>
<p>And, as a music lover, this is going to change.</p>
<p>We are a long age away from listening to the radio for hours with a blank cassette inside the tape player. Finger hovering over the record button just hoping you catch your favorite song before it starts.</p>
<p>Cursing silently when the DJ talks over the beginning, but happy you got it nonetheless.</p>
<p>I must have re-recorded over the tape a hundred times before I got the songs I wanted.</p>
<p>Today, the price we pay for any song at any time is an ad or two. Maybe a subscription.</p>
<p>It's a little bit of cash or a little bit of time. </p>
<p>And as much as I feel a bit torn about it all, I think ai is making some good music.</p>
<p>Yeah, I said it.</p>
<p>It follows the formula, and song is formula.</p>
<p>Take for example the ai song "New Year, I'm the Same ____" (1979). I warn you it's got some adult language.</p>
<p>Sheet rated R.</p>
<p>But it's got oldies soul vibes with a modern (timeless?) IDGAF mindset.</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm dancing to music created by software with the push of a few keys.</p>
<p>No DJs yapping at the beginning to screw things up.</p>
<p>No vulnerable cassettes eaten up by old, slowly disloyal, boomboxes.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to hold an iPhone sideways over your head rocking a Peter Gabriel song, but that just seems silly.</p>
<p>There's no better time machine than music.</p>
<p>A rare invention that can take you back, push you forward, and stir you up.</p>
<p>All at the same time.</p>
<p>Life is frequency.</p>
<p>Life is vibe.</p>
<p>Life is music.</p>
<p>What's your song?</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>So much of our lives, if you live it the traditional way, is about being chosen, rather than doing the choosing.</p>
<p>Picked for a team. Picked for the best grades. Picked for a position.</p>
<p>You work hard in school, obeying, abiding, and parroting for the distinct goal of being picked by another school for which you, if selected, get the dubious honor of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for the privilege of them choosing you.</p>
<p>Athletes get drafted out of school.</p>
<p>Every kid weeping at the idea that "Hey, I made it!"</p>
<p>Maybe different now with NIL money. But I'm rolling here.</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>Because they were chosen.</p>
<p>I have always liked the word. Chosen. Reminds me of Korea.</p>
<p>My point is simple.</p>
<p>One you might guess by now.</p>
<p>Being chosen is all well and good.</p>
<p>We're all chosen, if you think about it.</p>
<p>Apply for jobs. Interview for them. Maybe you get it.</p>
<p>It's an honor just to be nominated is a line I love to say (lol).</p>
<p><em>I always get it.</em></p>
<p>But listen.</p>
<p>This is a world of people waiting to be plucked.</p>
<p>Where it should be a world of mother pluckers.</p>
<p>You need to stop with things whose outcome is based upon some other person choosing you.</p>
<p>And you need to be the selector.</p>
<p>You choose, choose, choose you.</p>
<p>There is no better time in our timeline's timeline than now to be the decider in what you do, where you go, and who you will be as you get there.</p>
<p>Now, I'm sympathetic to those who are still in the choose-me ecosystem. </p>
<p>Who are trying to Neo out.</p>
<p>I get it. I live it (to some degree). It's everywhere.</p>
<p>But validation of worth through external measures is... What's the word I'm searching for? I don't know. </p>
<p>I remember getting my dream job offer (it's happened a few times now) and being so happy with being chosen. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You like me. You really like me!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same with school. Same with honors. Same with props. Attaboy, AC. Al, you the man.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I know. </p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I KNOW.</p>
<p>Boy, that sounds pompous, huh?</p>
<p>Tee hee.</p>
<p>Full of myself.</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>Old.</p>
<p>Lucky.</p>
<p>Blessed.</p>
<p>Chosen.</p>
<p>If you are the type to believe in Pareto Principles, then you see the 20% (probably much less) choose the 80% (much higher).</p>
<p>And with math being math that means most of you are just hoping you get the call.</p>
<p>While the chosen few got the pick of the litter.</p>
<p>What group you wanna be in?</p>
<p>So what I will leave with you is the question of what are you waiting for?</p>
<p>Who are you waiting for?</p>
<p>Does someone really get to tell you if they pick you or not?</p>
<p>Nah, baby, I pick.</p>
<p>That's what I want you to say.</p>
<p>I pick.</p>
<p>You are the chosen one.</p>
<p>At least, that's how I choose to see it.</p>

                <p>As you float through the cosmos, you learn that seemingly big problems and big wins are really just tiny.</p>
<p>At least from up here.</p>
<p>Heck, even our planet can look like a dot. </p>
<p>A speck.</p>
<p>Pocket sand remnants.</p>
<p>The spectrum of suffering to elation is lost up here.</p>
<p>It's all the same thing.</p>
<p>Meaningless.</p>
<p>Or rather, irrelevant.</p>
<p>Insignificant.</p>
<p>Rounding error.</p>
<p>All the chaos happening down there just doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>I say this as an stoic optimist.</p>
<p>I say this to encourage you.</p>
<p>You could be living in hell or heaven (on earth).</p>
<p>And it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>On a larger scale.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Or does it?</p>
<p>Does it matter universally?</p>
<p>Cosmically?</p>
<p>Existentially?</p>
<p>What if your happiness or sadness, jubilance or sorrow, is quantumly entangled to something out there in the universe?</p>
<p>What if you make someone else happy on some other galaxy when you're happy?</p>
<p>Mikmak Janpol from planet Starfarter (what a terrible name for a planet, but hey, I don't make the rules!) suddenly leaps for joy every time you laugh from your belly.</p>
<p>I walk this line between how trivial one person is in the scheme of reality to how important knowing that your reality is just the perspective of one person (hopefully your own).</p>
<p>But science, not just faith, <em>science</em> teaches us we are connected.</p>
<p>Entangled.</p>
<p>To something.</p>
<p>Something that could be really close.</p>
<p>Or, more likely (?), something really, really, really far away.</p>
<p>There could be a single cell in you tied to another cell on the other side of forever.</p>
<p>Isn't that weird?</p>
<p>Am I getting that right?</p>
<p>I'm probably making Einstein twitch.</p>
<p>Oh, Bert, don't ever change.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm just passing through.</p>
<p>Where am I going?</p>
<p>Ahhhh soooo, hopper of space, that is a wondrous question.</p>
<p>But I got to go.</p>
<p>I bet someone, or something - out <em>there</em> - is belly laughing.</p>
<p>I can feel it.</p>

<p>Why are you the way you are, and who gets the most credit (or blame) for it?</p>
<p>I think you should start asking people that.</p>
<p>You should start asking yourself.</p>
<p>Because you will get a lot of the answers you seek.</p>
<p>Answers you would never get otherwise.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you get perspective.</p>
<p>A point of view.</p>
<p>If your life was a TV show (do we still call it that?), would it be a drama? A comedy?</p>
<p>A tragedy?</p>
<p>A redemption story?</p>
<p>A love story?</p>
<p>Or an epic trilogy, perhaps?</p>
<p>How about a reality show?</p>
<p>True crime?</p>
<p>Paranormal?</p>
<p>Where you at?</p>
<p>When you on?</p>
<p>Sorry, this is just what I do.</p>
<p>When I want to learn more about something or someone, I ask a lot of questions of it.</p>
<p>Mostly, I never ask a question, though.</p>
<p>Not interested.</p>
<p>Hard pass.</p>
<p><em>Yawns</em>.</p>
<p>Next!</p>
<p>I have always felt like an outsider.</p>
<p>Always been an outsider.</p>
<p>Too much this to be that. Too much that to be this.</p>
<p>I liked to lift heavy things, even if only to open and read them.</p>
<p>Too New York for Cali. Too Cali for New York. Too Midwest to be Southern. Too Korean. Not enough Korean. Too Midwest to care about it at all (after a <em>looooooooong</em> long long  time). Long duck.</p>
<p>And so that's my answer.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>My outsiderness has given me the unique opportunity to find a home everywhere, with everyone.</p>
<p>With exiles and executives.</p>
<p>Janitors and jet flyers.</p>
<p>Rolexes and Timexes.</p>
<p>Noobs and grandmasters.</p>
<p>And let me tell you: Good people are rarely the star of their show.</p>
<p>The "stars" are usually asses.</p>
<p>Ass.</p>
<p>Es.</p>
<p>I mean, there are probably jerk janitors. </p>
<p>But do I have to convince you a CEO is a hole of buttocks?</p>
<p>Didn't think so.</p>
<p>And believe me, most CEOs think they are the leading man or lady.</p>
<p>Actually, I have no idea.</p>
<p>I don't care, really. Just seems like an easy and obvious example.</p>
<p><em>Yawns</em>.</p>
<p>Every life story, in the end, is a complete mashup of all of the above.</p>
<p>I simplify it and say every story is a love story. But really, in a life truly lived, you have elements of tragedy, drama, comedy, adventure, action, love, and redemption.</p>
<p>All of the above.</p>
<p>The order is important, I think.</p>
<p>A show about true crime ending in love and redemption - well that sounds pretty good.</p>
<p>A show about comedy and action ending in tragedy? Eek. Probably would get better ratings, though.</p>
<p>I'll end it here.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>
