            <![CDATA[
                <p>Only been writing again for the last couple of months, but it feels like a longer time.</p>
<p>I've been blessed (cursed?) with the ability to stop things I loved doing without missing it much.</p>
<p>I used to define myself by how much I could lift off my chest or over my head.</p>
<p>Always a spiritual sort, I prayed to heavy metal listening to heavy metal.</p>
<p>Found God there (and in a Muay Thai gym).</p>
<p>But I don't do it anymore.</p>
<p>Or at least for now I don't.</p>
<p>And I don't miss it (much).</p>
<p>You'd think I would, because it was a really big part of me, a big part of how I defined myself.</p>
<p>And that's how I kind of feel about writing.</p>
<p>I have written my entire life.</p>
<p>Have always loved the written word.</p>
<p>For a long time, I couldn't read or write anymore.</p>
<p>And that sucked. More than the not lifting thing. Which shocks me, writing that truth.</p>
<p>I started listening to stories and watching them.</p>
<p>And that helped, a lot, but it did not replace writing.</p>
<p>And so, all of that to just say, I'm very thankful to be able to type away again. To meander in my brain and pluck what I find and place it down on digital paper.</p>
<p>To ramble again, if no longer to rumble.</p>
<p>Rumbling is a young man's game.</p>
<p>Writing can be an old man's.</p>
<p>Something to look forward to (no old man here).</p>
<p>This might come across as sort of a down thing, but it's not. </p>
<p>It's the exact opposite.</p>
<p>An up thing.</p>
<p>I'm writing again.</p>
<p>Wrote everyday here since early October.</p>
<p>I'm back, baby!</p>
<p>Or, at least, I am <em>here</em>.</p>
<p>I still get things off my chest, just now in a different form.</p>
<p><em>Lightweight, easy, easy</em>.</p>
<p>What an interesting timeline.</p>
<p>To the last day of a good year.</p>
<p>Happy.</p>

<p>Last but one.</p>
<p>Second to last.</p>
<p>The one right before the one before.</p>
<p>Pen...ultimate!</p>
<p>What a cool way to say almost last.</p>
<p>So here we are writing about penultimates.</p>
<p>How goes things?</p>
<p>You good?</p>
<p>You might think my asking about you is just a delay tactic.</p>
<p>A way to avoid writing anything of substance.</p>
<p>And to that I say, "How dare you!?"</p>
<p>You're right of course, but feigned outrage is my way to counter most things.</p>
<p>I got nothing to say, man. I'm still here.</p>
<p>I still believe in magic.</p>
<p>I know how the trick is done.</p>
<p>I know it by heart.</p>
<p>But I still believe in magic.</p>
<p>Watch this day vanish.</p>
<p>Poof!</p>
<p><em>How'd he do that?</em></p>
<p>And then the next one!</p>
<p>Poof!</p>
<p><em>Woah!</em></p>
<p>The whole year gone!</p>
<p>The trick is making the seconds last, even on the second to last.</p>
<p><em>POOF!</em></p>

        <content type="html">
            <![CDATA[
                <p>One of the reasons I like to try new things is because after a while, things can start sounding like an echo chamber.</p>
<p>You hear the same things over and over.</p>
<p>The same stuff said in a different way.</p>
<p>Groups agreeing with one another on everything and everyone.</p>
<p>And any ideas to the contrary are disregarded at best.</p>
<p>For me, I could agree with you vehemently on something, but if you keep pounding the idea home, I start to see the contrary views. </p>
<p>Your certainty makes me doubt.</p>
<p>So I stay away from fanatics. </p>
<p>On all sides.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps better said, keep them at a distance.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite ideas are led by people who basically say:</p>
<p>If you don't get it, you're just a moron.</p>
<p>Which, you should know by now, I understand.</p>
<p>Maybe it's the smugness.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why my brain goes, "Well, maybe there is another view here."</p>
<p>I always liked a well-written dissent over the more popular majority opinion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How are you liking the company?"</p>
<p>"Well, this company feels like a Goliath. And I have always been a David guy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And maybe that's it.</p>
<p>Maybe if a room feels like it's full of drooling, nodding, giants, I instinctively grab my rounds.</p>
<p>Has the art of cordial disagreement faded away?</p>
<p>Agree to disagree?</p>
<p>Do professors still give out their best grades to students who disagree with their point of view, but do so so articulately and well-reasoned that it deserves a top grade?</p>
<p>My concern is it seems the world is flocking more and more into these silos of safety.</p>
<p>Where everyone in this silo has to think a certain way.</p>
<p>They all say the same things, believe the same things, and if you do not, well then, please see yourself out.</p>
<p>I am proud to say I have very few people I would call true friends. And believe it or not, some of them disagree with me. I know, I know, impossible, you say.</p>
<p>But it's true. They have their own ideas. Their own guidelines. And when I need to hear another side to an angle I am considering, I go there first.</p>
<p>Break this argument.</p>
<p>Shatter it.</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>
<p>Don't echo.</p>
<p>Counter.</p>
<p>Left jab?</p>
<p>Right straight.</p>
<p>Left headkick?</p>
<p>Right legkick.</p>
<p>Get out of them chambers that have endless mirrors.</p>
<p>Who wants a million versions of themselves looking back at them?</p>
<p><em>Woah, cool.</em></p>

                <p>One of the things I have always tried to distill is this idea of success.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>How do you measure it?</p>
<p>How will you know when you are "successful?"</p>
<p>I mean, does a bell chime or does some little guy dressed as an elf dance at your side when it happens?</p>
<p>I think too many of us measure success by net worth.</p>
<p>And I suppose that's one way to do it.</p>
<p>I grew up with a terrible sense of money.</p>
<p>Didn't have much, didn't need much.</p>
<p>Maybe that's not so terrible.</p>
<p>But what I'm getting at is can you be a great family man <em>and</em> succeed in business?</p>
<p>Who's done that?</p>
<p>And who gets to measure whether you are successful or not?</p>
<p>You, your portfolio, or your family?</p>
<p>And what about your soul, your fortitude, your honor? </p>
<p>Does that matter in the "success" formula?</p>
<p>I mean, ain't that the most important stick?</p>
<p>What I'm getting at is:</p>
<p>Did you have a good year?</p>
<p>And no matter your answer, how are you defining it?</p>

<p>Some things do not belong on a blog.</p>

<p>I'm yelling at people who cut in lines again.</p>
<p>I suppose that's something.</p>
<p>"Line starts back here, boys!"</p>
<p>That is kind of funny to me.</p>
<p>And then no-selling the "Oh, sorry" response.</p>

<p>Oh, is this thing on?</p>
<p>Listen, I hope you had yourself a Merry little Christmas.</p>
<p>And now, you find yourself getting ready to celebrate the end of the old year and to welcome the new.</p>
<p>I should wax on and wax off about ends and beginnings.</p>

<p>Everyone does that.</p>
<p>And if you know a little something about me, I don't do what everyone does.</p>
<p>So here's what I will say.</p>
<p>Most of them out there are going to be lazy these last few days.</p>
<p>So there's opportunity in being especially active now.</p>
<p>While the others are celebrating, it is a great time to put in the work.</p>
<p>Sure, it's only a couple of days, but maybe you strike gold, while everyone else is drinking it.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Years ago, I remember Joe Rogan sharing a story on his show.</p>
<p>This was way back before he became <em>the</em> dude in podcasting.</p>
<p>I don't listen to many podcasts anymore, but back then he would just go on and on about whatever the heck with his co-host.</p>
<p>And this one day, he's on a roll.</p>
<p>Talking about how we take so much for granted.</p>
<p>And he set it up this way.</p>
<p>Which is how I think I can best define what I mean by "sacralize" aka my new favorite word.</p>
<p>He said, imagine living underground for your entire life. You only know caves and tunnels and passages and nothing else. Everyone lives this way.</p>
<p>And one day, you hear about this ultimate attraction.</p>
<p>It's at the end of a tunnel that leads up. Impossibly up.</p>
<p>And if you have enough money, you can pay to go there.</p>
<p>And the few people who have gone rave about it forever.</p>
<p>They just can't believe it's there.</p>
<p>So you save up, wait for your window (because it's only open during certain hours), and you go.</p>
<p>You pay the enormous admission fee and see for yourself.</p>
<p>And you climb up this ladder for seemingly forever in this narrow tunnel which leads to a little room with a hole in the ceiling.</p>
<p>And through the opening you can see it.</p>
<p>The above world.</p>
<p>The outside world.</p>
<p>The night's sky.</p>
<p>And more importantly, the unlimited (give or take) amount of stars in the sky.</p>
<p>And you sit and stare in awe.</p>
<p>Forever changed.</p>
<p>You'll spend the rest of your life underground talking about what you saw.</p>
<p>Most will never believe you.</p>
<p>And I suppose that's what I mean by sacralizing.</p>
<p>We don't sacralize the night's starry skies because it is just so routine for us.</p>
<p>But if we lived underground, and had to pay to see the stars, we would sacralize it.</p>
<p>Because it deserves it.</p>
<p>And I remember Rogan telling this story and just thinking how right he was.</p>
<p>How we would make it a holy pilgrimage to see the night's lights.</p>
<p>If it just wasn't available almost every single night of our lives.</p>
<p>And that's the trick of sacralization.</p>
<p>You make it sacred even though, and especially because, it is so routine.</p>
<p>Yes, it is just what happens on a clear evening.</p>
<p>Stars just show themselves.</p>
<p>But it is also something sacred.</p>
<p>Both can be true.</p>
<p>Both are true.</p>
<p>And so, 'tis the season to remember such things.</p>
<p>How beautiful things are that you see everyday.</p>
<p>It doesn't make them less important, I argue it does the exact opposite.</p>
<p>The beautiful and important things you see everyday are more beautiful and more important because you see them everyday.</p>
<p>Not less.</p>
<p>I've learned the best things in life are free.</p>
<p>But you have to earn them to keep them.</p>
<p>Understand?</p>
<p>So next time, maybe every time from here on out, you look up and see a million stars, you experience it as if you had to spend your life's savings earned living underground to see it.</p>
<p>And the realization that hey, <em>hey</em>, this is just given to me.</p>
<p>And do that, do that same thing, when you look down, and from side to side while you're at it.</p>
<p>And I think, <em>I think</em>, that's the secret recipe to all of this.</p>
