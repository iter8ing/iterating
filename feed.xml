<p>"I'm a what?"</p>
<p>"A dabbler, someone who pretends to be an expert but really just knows a little about a lot."</p>
<p>"Oh. I am not."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I'm a dilettante.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways.</p>
<p>I didn't always know what that meant, and I suppose I still really don't.</p>
<p>I mean, I love a lot of things.</p>
<p>Interested in a lot of things.</p>
<p>Some things I dig deeper.</p>
<p>Most things I dig for a little.</p>
<p>I always respect and admire those who can center and hone in on their one thing.</p>
<p>Like my buddy who loves to weld.</p>
<p>But reality is, I like to dabble.</p>
<p>Call it whatever you want, but I just enjoy learning something new.</p>
<p>And even after all these years, after all I think I know, I continue to find "new" areas.</p>
<p>Now most of these have been around forever, but I never saw them. Even if they highly overlapped the areas I have been interested in for decades.</p>
<p>To me, that's so neat.</p>
<p>Bruce Lee said something like how he doesn't fear the man who has practiced 10,000 different techniques once. But rather fears the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.</p>
<p>And that's right. You would fear a dude with one massive overbuilt leg.</p>
<p>But hear me out.</p>
<p>How would you fare against the man who practiced 10,000 different techniques ten times? A hundred?</p>
<p>I'm just saying.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>I've always been careful to keep my circles separate.</p>
<p>Family friends. Work friends. School friends. Old school friends. Digital friends.</p>
<p>Each in their own category. </p>
<p>Never the two shall mix.</p>
<p>I don't know why I'd do that.</p>
<p>In the few times they did actually interact, it felt like some wacky crossover episode had taken place, and I didn't quite know how to act.</p>
<p>For you see, in each circle, I was a different version of "me."</p>
<p>I see that now.</p>
<p>I didn't see it then.</p>
<p>The reason I didn't overlap the circles was because I didn't know how to be <em>me</em> when they mixed.</p>
<p>Was I school Alex? Work Alex? OG Alex? Digital Alex?</p>
<p>Very few have seen me with my hair down, so to speak, and that's probably for the best.</p>
<p>The point of all this is how so many haven't changed. And how so many have.</p>
<p>And I don't know which one is better: Those who haven't changed and those who have.</p>
<p>I know I've changed.</p>
<p>I still don't venn diagram my life. But there are no separate circles, now. Just one special one.</p>
<p>I sit in it and pilot it around this vast program called reality. My copilots actively keeping everything running, while I try to keep us on course.</p>
<p>Every now and again, another circle, past or future, approaches.</p>
<p>I let them bounce, though.</p>
<p>They don't get in.</p>
<p>This is the hermit in me, I know.</p>
<p>But the fella they're looking for is long gone.</p>
<p>Went to never never land and never came home.</p>
<p>...Did they leave yet?</p>
<p>Ok, good.</p>
<p>I know who I am now.</p>
<p>I know how to play it.</p>
<p>I am bubbles clustered together. So many.</p>
<p>That one day popped into one big bubble.</p>
<p>I believe in the sanctity of this bubble. </p>
<p>I <em>sacralize</em> it.</p>
<p>There is no place in the world I would rather be, than where I am right now. With who I am with right now.</p>
<p>Floating through the cosmos.</p>

                <p>They say kids are made out of rubber. </p>
<p>Not literally of course.</p>
<p>More in the way they can bounce back from injury.</p>
<p>And I see it.</p>
<p>How fast my kids can heal from a bump or owwie.</p>
<p>I don't know what adults are made out of, but I marvel at how my body fixes itself.</p>
<p>It is very cyclical.</p>
<p>Up days. Down days.</p>
<p>Flushing out. Feeding in.</p>
<p>Give. </p>
<p>Take.</p>
<p>I want to make something clear.</p>
<p>I'm thankful for every setback.</p>
<p>Because it comes with a hidden perk.</p>
<p>I just have to figure it out.</p>
<p>The body is a universe onto itself.</p>
<p>I don't think we think about this enough.</p>
<p>Sure, bodies are temples, but they're way more than that.</p>
<p>They're vast. Infinite when you zoom in.</p>
<p>Full of life, giving you life. The total system working together (sometimes against each other) to keep you running.</p>
<p>This is not appreciated enough.</p>
<p>At least by me.</p>
<p>I'm working on it though.</p>
<p>You know what's weird?</p>
<p>Supposedly, we are made up of more nothing than something.</p>
<p>We are. The world is. Everything in the universe.</p>
<p>We are more space than substance.</p>
<p>That ess crazy.</p>
<p>Don't believe it.</p>
<p>You're more something than nothing.</p>
<p>You're all something.</p>
<p>We just haven't figured out the right way to name the nothing.</p>
<p>There's probably a centillion nothings that are somethings. </p>
<p>We just don't know how to delineate between them.</p>
<p>Or how to see them.</p>
<p>This is not a very good post. </p>
<p>Better than nothing.</p>

                <p>I'm writing again today. Just to see if I can do it.</p>
<p>I wonder how sustainable it is to just type by feel. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I can still see. I'm fine.</p>
<p>It's just typing on my computer has suddenly turned... off.</p>
<p>I think I have sensitivity to certain screens. Too much flashing/refreshing/wa wah.</p>
<p>As someone who loves tech, this is a bit of a bummer. But I'm going to roll with it. I'm in no shape to complain. I just will figure a work around.</p>
<p>Closing my eyes to type is the first workaround.</p>
<p>Writing by feel.</p>
<p>I've been a bit under the weather so that's probably the reason.</p>
<p>Who knows.</p>
<p>What I know is that this writing thing is wired into my OS and I'm not going to stop over some vision thing.</p>
<p>I wish I had something more to say it's just not going to happen until I get into a groove with this eyes closed typing thing.</p>
<p>Living up to this site's domain name.</p>
<p>Hypothesis. Testing. Receiving feedback. Updating based on feedback. New hypothesis. More testing.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>This whole iterating thing is relatively new to me.</p>
<p>I used to only want to be perfect. Never fail. And I wasn't bad at it. But this made me not try the hardest things. Or prepare for them. I just jumped into them. Head first. </p>
<p>Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it made a great story.</p>
<p>However, this was a weakness in my youth. </p>
<p>I can write blind.</p>
<p>I <em>will</em> write blind.</p>
<p>But I can see.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>The only way to get to perfect is to fail. Over and over.</p>
<p>I know that now.</p>
<p>Jordan had to fight the Bad Boys (and lose - over and over).</p>
<p>Lose first. Win later.</p>
<p>You can't stop this ess. This thing overflowing.</p>
<p>My font runneth over.</p>
<p>I love fonts.</p>
<p>Ok, goodbye for now.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you ever run into past me, tell me you read my future website and that you're a time traveler and there's this small window of time where I can't see my screen so good and that everything will be fine except you're not sure because you had to jump into the time machine again before you could read any more posts.</p>
<p>Oh, and make sure you tell past me, that future me loves him.</p>
<p>Man, I could go on forever.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Perhaps, I have figured out a way to keep writing.</p>
<p>I took a typing class in eight grade that changed my life.</p>
<p>We all worked on big mechanical metal typewriters and we learned by starting with the individual keys covered with little white stickers.</p>
<p>We learned to type by feel. Not sight. Well, I think we had an overhead projector that showed where the keys were, but we couldn't look down at the keys for help.</p>
<p>We had to train our fingers to know which letters they were responsible for.</p>
<p>The pinkies had the least responsibility, whereas the index and middle got the brunt.</p>
<p>Anyways, my point being, perhaps I can type with my eyes closed.</p>
<p>I can peek at the keys but I know when my fingers strike true.</p>
<p>This is not an ideal way to write, but I somehow feel more attuned to writing this way.</p>
<p>My eyes aren't fighting the screen, I'm keeping them mostly closed, just my fingers hunting the board. I know this seems like a cruel twist of fate, but I have learned we just never know what's going to happen and that there is no sustained new normals.</p>
<p>Only seasons. Windows of time.</p>
<p>Take nothing for granted.</p>
<p>I can type this way. Not sure how great I'll write. But I suppose you could have asked that all along.</p>
<p>I can write with my eyes closed. What a blessing that is. I hope to share more substantive stuff in the near future. But forgive me any typos. </p>
<p>The key to typing by feel is knowing where you are. I touch my index fingers together to make sure they are aligned and in the right position. Otherwise, it's anarchy.</p>
<p>What I am learning is that I must write. If only for myself. And some times, many times, all the time, when you must have something, you are tested.</p>
<p>So, I suppose, this is some sort of test.</p>
<p>That's ok. </p>
<p>And, as I have learned to say, even in nonoptimal conditions, what does this make possible?</p>
<p>I just realized, for the first time ever, that the "j" and "f" keys (where your index fingers rest), have a little notch at the bottom. None of the other keys do. I think this is so you know where to orient them. Where to rest them.</p>
<p>I remember doing that now. When learning to type. I would peel a corner of a sticker for each hand, so I could feel a certain letter. I'd peel the corner up on "a" and "l" keys so I knew where they were by feel, fi not by sight.</p>
<p>Have "f" and "j" always been so distinguished? Weird, I never noticed.</p>
<p>I will now. </p>
<p>All because I starting writing by feel.</p>

<p>I can still write, and I still plan to, but it's a bit more difficult now.</p>

                <p>Most of us, especially our young ones, seek the <em>peak</em> experience.</p>
<p>The high spots.</p>
<p>The highlights.</p>
<p>The explosive.</p>
<p>Anyone can see glimmers of this with their own two eyes, their heart, their soul. The select few have tasted it, breathed it, and lived it.</p>
<p>And almost like a drug, you can spend an eternity trying to recapture that initial experience. Chasing fleeting moments like ghost hares. Trying to snatch that rabbit's foot one more time.</p>
<p>More rare, and more rewarding, I have learned, is the <em>plateau</em> experience (a terrible name, btw - we will rename it) signifying a prolonged experience of elevated and profound joy.</p>
<p>An ability like this is earned over a lifetime. Meaning, with few exceptions in an already exceptional few, this is a superpower reserved for those who have accumulated a good amount of yesterdays.</p>
<p>As we grow older, the wise say, we should stop chasing Alpha Centauri, and just learn to appreciate how beautiful the full moon is.</p>
<p>Still celestial, still infinite, still divine, just with a more sustainable point of view.</p>
<p>Peaks are awesome. But plateaus can be forever.</p>
<p>And if I have to choose, I choose forever.</p>
<p>But I'm just getting old.</p>
<p>Hit a lot of peaks. Fell in more valleys.</p>
<p>Right now, I'll just enjoy the view.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>They say you have to die a little to be truly reborn.</p>
<p>I feel that ess, to the bone.</p>
<p>I died a little.</p>
<p>And I am new.</p>
<p>I hear the moon will be beautiful tonight.</p>
<p>But Alpha Centauri calls.</p>

                <p>This show I was watching, a documentary of sorts, showed a dad talking about his daughter.</p>
<p>You could tell this man loved his daughter. You could see it in his eyes.</p>
<p>And he sweetly recalled telling her over the years, time and time again, that he's got a lot more yesterdays than she does. But, and more importantly, she has a lot more tomorrows.</p>
<p>This wasn't a happy show, because he shares this knowing his daughter has passed on, and he says he's now living with only yesterdays. No more tomorrows for him.</p>
<p>And I feel his pain.</p>
<p>I found his story profoundly touching.</p>
<p>How we have a (predetermined?) allotment of yesterdays and tomorrows.</p>
<p>I have a lot of yesterdays in my life. I'd like to think I have a bunch of tomorrows coming. Same for my loved ones. Especially those with not a lot of yesterdays racked up. A whole mountain of tomorrows. A starfaring stack of 'em.</p>
<p>But we simply do not know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I only hope.</p>
<p>I wish.</p>
<p>I pray.</p>
<p>And I know there is so much truth in a life <em>well</em> lived being worth far more than a life <em>long</em> lived. </p>
<p>But I wish more than anything, as a father, for far more tomorrows for my children than I have had yesterdays. And that someday, they remember their yesterdays as being as sweet as my todays.</p>
<p>They say only the good die young, and I believe that (to some degree), but that doesn't mean the good can't die old.</p>
<p><em>Only</em> the good die young.</p>
<p>Not <em>all</em> of the good.</p>
<p><em>Some</em> good die old.</p>
<p>This, like many things, makes me so grateful for the right nows.</p>
<p>To the well lived, long life.</p>
<p>And to yesterdays, tomorrows, and everything in between.</p>

                <p>I used to really get a kick out of commencement speeches.</p>
<p>The whole idea fascinated me.</p>
<p>Distilling your life's lessons into one speech in front of bored students.</p>
<p>To provide the future of the world with our best, carefully curated, nuggets of accumulated wisdom.</p>
<p>So I would watch them.</p>
<p>And try to be an eternal student.</p>
<p>I suppose I should again.</p>
<p>Haven't watched one in years.</p>
<p>I heard a line the other day that I really enjoyed.</p>
<p>That old line about when the student is ready, the master appears.</p>
<p>But they added a line.</p>
<p>When the student is <em>truly</em> ready, the master disappears.</p>
<p>I dig it.</p>
<p>When the student is ready, the master appears.</p>
<p>When the student is <em>truly</em> ready...</p>
<p>Poof.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Just kidding, still here!</p>
<p>We got work to do, kids.</p>
<p>COMMENCE!</p>
