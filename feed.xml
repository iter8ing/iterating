            <![CDATA[
                <p>As a self-proclaimed martial artist of little to no renown, I seek the Way.</p>
<p>How do I define the Way?</p>
<p>When Bruce Lee first taught in America, the old Chinese masters had a problem with it.</p>
<p>For lots of reasons, but for two main ones:</p>
<p>1) He taught others besides (but including) Chinese people.</p>
<p>2) He taught more than one way.</p>
<p>Bruce came to the conclusion that you study and practice all arts, adding what is useful and discarding what it is not. In martial and other arts.</p>
<p>But the old folks are stuck in their ways.</p>
<p>In their Way.</p>
<p>There are no other Ways.</p>
<p>Just one.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just old people trying to protect older ideas.</p>
<p>In an era where nothing is sacred (always the present), they wanted to keep something so (always the past).</p>
<p>Change is scary.</p>
<p>Change is unknown.</p>
<p>Change is future.</p>
<p>But the thing about chasing other Ways is that you aren't disrespecting, you are being the most respectful. </p>
<p>How do you know the strengths of your beliefs if they are never tested?</p>
<p>If you don't seek other Ways?</p>
<p>Belief must be tested.</p>
<p>After all you have gone through, after all you are going through, and after all you will go through, will you still believe?</p>
<p>What has stayed the same?</p>
<p>What has changed?</p>
<p>What should change?</p>
<p>Seek and try other ways.</p>
<p>As many as you can.</p>
<p>Test it against your status quo.</p>
<p>Keep what works.</p>
<p>Discard the rest.</p>
<p>This is my Way.</p>

                <p>Today is a very special day.</p>
<p>I won't say why because some things are just for me.</p>
<p>I always thought I would end up alone on some mountain top in rural Korea.</p>
<p>Contemplating and striking the air and wooden things.</p>
<p>You know, monk type ess.</p>
<p>And I suppose there is a universe where I am doing just that.</p>
<p>But not this one.</p>
<p>In this one, I have to nurture and love ivory and two precious mixtures of ivory and gold.</p>
<p>Yes, they all drive me crazy, but I suppose everything I have ever loved does.</p>
<p>So alas, my mountain top is digital.</p>
<p>My alone is in brief pockets of time. </p>
<p>I am the <em>richest man in the world</em>.</p>
<p>A hermit with a fortune.</p>
<p>Just like I dreamed.</p>

                <p>Are your memories treasure?</p>
<p>Or are your visions of the future the treasure?</p>
<p>What about the present?</p>
<p>Is right now considered a treasure?</p>
<p>They all seem pretty valuable.</p>
<p>Treasure hunters are an interesting group.</p>
<p>Chasing futures where they hope to find the valued past right now or somewhat soonish.</p>
<p>Someone's past, found in someone else's present, for yet another someone else's future.</p>
<p>Actually finding the treasure comes with all sorts of drama (like all big moments).</p>
<p>You may not even be able to keep it.</p>
<p>The law, ya know.</p>
<p>Ahh, but the chase is yours.</p>
<p>They can't take that away, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Did they take that away?</p>
<p>How big is your fortune?</p>
<p>Is it vaulted in your heart?</p>
<p>Is it in the cloud in your brain?</p>
<p>Or can you touch it with your lips?</p>
<p>Are you the treasure?</p>
<p>Yours or anyone else's?</p>
<p>Somewhere between remembering and imagining is present day.</p>
<p>Vault, earth, cloud.</p>
<p>I'd say carpe diem or some ess, but I hear they cancelled Latin.</p>

                <p>I almost forgot to write again.</p>
<p>Some days just fly by.</p>
<p>Most days do.</p>
<p>As you get older, the seconds, minutes, hours, and days just seem a bit shorter.</p>
<p>Even the microwave timer I set for a few comfortable minutes seems to take me by surprise.</p>
<p><em>Already? I thought I had more time.</em></p>
<p>Kids never want the day to end.</p>
<p>They can spend an eternity in a day and still want it to last a little longer.</p>
<p>My little ones are how I measure time now.</p>
<p>I don't <em>feel</em> old.</p>
<p>I just act it.</p>
<p>Always have.</p>
<p>But when I see how big they're getting, well, do the math.</p>
<p>This is a very wonderful season. In the year. Of my life.</p>
<p>If you don't know by now, I believe time is the truest and most precious currency. </p>
<p>And attention is how we pay.</p>
<p>Are you paying attention to how you spend your time?</p>
<p>Tick tock. </p>
<p>Ever wonder why they call the app that?</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Ever hear the idea that insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result?</p>
<p>This is a <em>mostly</em> true statement.</p>
<p>But there are always exceptions to every rule. Exceptions so few that they prove the rule.</p>
<p>For example, do you know how they split really big rocks?</p>
<p>One person grabs a big hammer.</p>
<p>Said person smashes said hammer on big rock. </p>
<p>It does nothing.</p>
<p>They smash it again in the same spot.</p>
<p>Over and over again.</p>
<p>Expecting it to crack.</p>
<p>It doesn't.</p>
<p>Not right away.</p>
<p>They just keep smacking the rock.</p>
<p>Same spot.</p>
<p>Over and over.</p>
<p>The key is patience. And knowing where and how to strike.</p>
<p>They just keep smashing away.</p>
<p>Then you know what happens?</p>
<p>After a long time, and a lot of reps, the rock just suddenly splits.</p>
<p>A bat ess crazy person probably discovered this.</p>
<p>So, for your consideration:</p>
<p>What are you doing, over and over, expecting a different result?</p>
<p>And are you splitting a rock or swinging at a shadow?</p>
<p>Three feet from gold or digging your own grave?</p>
<p>Find good hammer.</p>
<p>Find good rock. </p>
<p>Find right spot to smash.</p>
<p>Smash rock in right spot.</p>
<p>Over and over.</p>
<p>Nothing happens.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>
<p>Rock splits.</p>
<p>Good work.</p>
<p>Good rock.</p>
<p>Good human.</p>
<p>Next rock...</p>

                <p>I'm just happy to be here.</p>
<p>I know sometimes it's not clear.</p>
<p>That's the old curmudgeon in me.</p>
<p>But I've always been this way.</p>
<p>Right now, all of this, every single ridiculous post, is me reeling from the reality of how a man who plays the long game almost passes, but survives.</p>
<p>Lives to fight another day.</p>
<p>A most fortunate man.</p>
<p>How do you keep thinking and planning the future when you're just enjoying, and grateful for, today?</p>
<p>I tell those closest to me that I'm in my absurd phase.</p>
<p>I'm going for absurd.</p>
<p>It seems like a fun way to play it.</p>
<p>All of this, after all, is the stuff of fairy tales.</p>
<p>Magic and wonder.</p>
<p>I sit in awe of it all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if I'm not the same, the next question is, "Who in the world am I?" Ah! That's the great puzzle!</p>

<p>And they lived happily ever after.</p>

                <p>Would you do it again?</p>
<p>I asked this question to the wife of a well-known author, during a lunch we shared with our families. She had told us of all their struggles. And how they were thriving in the good.</p>
<p>Would she do it all again?</p>
<p>She hesitated, deep in thought.</p>
<p>After what felt like a minute, but was only a few long seconds, she said, "Yes, I would, but I wouldn't want to live through all of it again."</p>
<p>My wife and I traveled across the country to meet this couple.</p>
<p>At the time, I was searching for answers. </p>
<p>I suppose I still am.</p>
<p>At the time, it felt like such a win, to be able to poke around the brain of someone you admired.</p>
<p>I don't remember a single thing about what he talked about.</p>
<p>But I remember her answer.</p>

<p>"All the praise when you're successful and all the hatred when things go bad...Don't take criticism from someone you wouldn't take advice from."</p>
