                <p>So I don't know how you found me. But I am glad you did (I think). I don't market but I think I'm a marketer. I am a lawyer but I haven't practiced in years. I know I can sell but I never want to. One thing I am certain of is I love to write. Or I used to. Before I almost died.</p>
<p>I'm a word nerd. I love words. And if you searched for "iterating.com" and found me that way, you're probably a nerd, too, of some sort.</p>
<p>Right now, I've reduced my life to two words: Iterating and Actualization.</p>
<p>The process that leads to the potential.</p>
