            <![CDATA[
                <p>For over a year, I couldn't eat kimchi.</p>
<p>This might not matter to you, but to a Korean adult, taking away their kimchi is just cruel.</p>
<p>It's not like I didn't have it around.</p>
<p>My family devours it.</p>
<p>I just went through some ess. And a part of said ess messed up my chew and taste buds.</p>
<p>And for a long time, it was just meat shakes.</p>
<p>Literal meat shakes.</p>
<p>During this time, I made a deal.</p>
<p>Ok, God, if the terms are I get to live, but I have to give up kimchi, I'll do it.</p>
<p>It wasn't easy, but I agreed.</p>
<p>Since that year, within the last year or so, I've been given the gift of taste back. I'm not sure if it's what I've always had or if it differs, but I'm thankful that kimchi tastes <em>GOOOOOOD</em>.</p>
<p>For every day of my life, for nearly every meal of my life, I've had kimchi.</p>
<p>Except for a stretch of just a little over a year, when kimchi just didn't sound good. I couldn't eat it if I wanted.</p>
<p>All of that to say, the things we take for granted, the things we consider essential, may or may not be so.</p>
<p>I did fine without the kimchi, I mean I lived, but it wasn't as essential as I thought.</p>
<p>It was just a food.</p>
<p>So I ask, what is truly essential? What <em>must</em> be?</p>
<p>What are you believing you <em>have</em> to have in your life, that just ain't true?</p>
<p>And what is truly sacred?</p>
<p>Truly holy?</p>
<p>I used to think kimchi was. I mean I still love it. But I went over a year without it.</p>
<p>It's just a jar of fermentation, like all of us. </p>
<p>I lost a lot during that season, but nothing I couldn't live without, although I would have been wrong about that if you'd asked me before it all happened.</p>
<p>The things I considered essential then are no longer so.</p>
<p>A nice to have. Not a must have. Never was a must have. I just thought that it was.</p>
<p>There are very, very, very few <em>must</em> haves.</p>
<p>I'm spending more and more time thinking about that.</p>
<p>But right now, I <em>get</em> to eat kimchi.</p>
<p>What a privilege.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>When I was growing up, there was a theory.</p>
<p>That a guy needed his butt whooped to truly be a man.</p>
<p>His arse need kicked.</p>
<p>It was just a rite of passage.</p>
<p>And you could mostly tell, from their actions and/or attitude, whether said kickage had taken place in their lives.</p>
<p>It, to me, is a measure of character. Of respect.</p>
<p>There's a lack of respect these days. Particularly self-respect. Self-pride is off the charts. But self-respect is in a recession at best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That person needs their whoopin'!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose I still say that today.</p>
<p>As a man of peace, this is more a fleeting thought in a glimmer of flame.</p>
<p>I don't really say it.</p>
<p>I'm a pacifist, man. </p>
<p>Truly.</p>
<p>Peace. Love. All that ess.</p>
<p>Next time, though, you see someone acting a fool, remember my wisdom.</p>
<p>It really eliminates 99% of your outrage.</p>
<p>Should you have any. </p>
<p>As a man of peace (have I said that yet?), I have a little (out)rage.</p>
<p>Yang to my yin, as they say (no one says that). </p>
<p>Have I told you I'm going for absurd?</p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>

                <p>We talk about odds.</p>
<p>Like you have a 1 in a 1000 chance to do this.</p>
<p>Or you have a 1% chance to succeed in that.</p>
<p>But the reality is, for most people, we only care about the results.</p>
<p>For example, if you had a 99% likelihood to pass a test, but you fail it, is there any solace in knowing you had such a high probability of passing? No, the only result you care about is your own.</p>
<p>So to me, I think most things are 50/50.</p>
<p>They happen or they don't.</p>
<p>Data is important.</p>
<p>But I don't care about the odds as it pertains to me.</p>
<p>It's always binary.</p>
<p>0.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Heads.</p>
<p>Tails. </p>
<p>Win.</p>
<p>Lose.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>As a self-proclaimed martial artist of little to no renown, I seek the Way.</p>
<p>How do I define the Way?</p>
<p>When Bruce Lee first taught in America, the old Chinese grandmasters had a problem with it.</p>
<p>For lots of reasons, but for two main ones:</p>
<p>1) He taught others besides (but including) Chinese people.</p>
<p>2) He taught more than one way.</p>
<p>Bruce came to the conclusion that you study and practice all arts, adding what is useful and discarding what is not. In martial and other arts.</p>
<p>But old folks (especially Chinese grandmasters) are stuck in their ways.</p>
<p>In their Way.</p>
<p>There are no other Ways.</p>
<p>Just one.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just old people trying to protect older ideas.</p>
<p>In an era where nothing is sacred (always the present), they wanted to keep something so (always the past).</p>
<p>Change is scary.</p>
<p>Change is unknown.</p>
<p>Change is future.</p>
<p>But the thing about chasing other Ways is that you aren't disrespecting, you are being the most respectful. </p>
<p>How do you know the strengths of your beliefs if they are never tested?</p>
<p>If you don't seek other Ways?</p>
<p>Belief must be tested.</p>
<p>After all you have gone through, after all you are going through, and after all you will go through, what will you still believe?</p>
<p>What has stayed the same?</p>
<p>What has changed?</p>
<p>What should change?</p>
<p>Seek and try other Ways.</p>
<p>As many as you can.</p>
<p>Test it against your status quo.</p>
<p>Keep what works.</p>
<p>Discard the rest.</p>
<p>Treasure what works.</p>
<p>Throw away what does not.</p>
<p><em>Throw away what does not!</em></p>
<p>THROW AWAY WHAT DOES NOT!</p>
<p>Most of us know what to keep.</p>
<p>It's knowing what to throw away that you keep hanging onto, that's the killer.</p>
<p>There are other Ways.</p>
<p>This is mine.</p>

<p>I won't say why because some things are just for me.</p>

<p>You know, monk type ess.</p>
<p>And I suppose there is a universe where I am doing just that.</p>

<p>In this one, I have to nurture and love ivory and two precious mixtures of ivory and gold.</p>
<p>Yes, they all drive me crazy, but I suppose everything I have ever loved does.</p>
<p>So alas, my mountain top is digital.</p>
<p>My alone is in brief pockets of time. </p>

                <p>I almost forgot to write again.</p>
<p>Some days just fly by.</p>
<p>Most days do.</p>
<p>As you get older, the seconds, minutes, hours, and days just seem a bit shorter.</p>
<p>Even the microwave timer I set for a few comfortable minutes seems to take me by surprise.</p>
<p><em>Already? I thought I had more time.</em></p>
<p>Kids never want the day to end.</p>
<p>They can spend an eternity in a day and still want it to last a little longer.</p>
<p>My little ones are how I measure time now.</p>
<p>I don't <em>feel</em> old.</p>
<p>I just act it.</p>
<p>Always have.</p>
<p>But when I see how big they're getting, well, do the math.</p>
<p>This is a very wonderful season. In the year. Of my life.</p>
<p>If you don't know by now, I believe time is the truest and most precious currency. </p>
<p>And attention is how we pay.</p>
<p>Are you paying attention to how you spend your time?</p>
<p>Tick tock. </p>
