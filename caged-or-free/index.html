And the topic came up that I was into mixed martial arts, training Muay Thai and whatever. And this old lion shared that he represented one of the most famous fighters in the all the land. </p><p>Surprised, I asked him the only thing I could think to ask. "Is he a good guy?"</p><p>And what he said next stuck with me for the rest of my life. He thought for a moment, smiled, and said, "Alex, he is either the smartest man I have ever met, or the dumbest."</p><p>And I rolled.</p><p>What an answer.</p><p>I've asked a million questions in my life. Hope to ask a million more. And yet I've never heard an answer quite like it. And I don't think I ever will.</p><p>It spoke a lot of the old lion to give the guy the benefit of the doubt, kinda like we used to say crazy like a fox. Maybe there's a glimmer of shrewdness in someone's blank stare.</p><p>Or maybe, they just took too many to the golden dome.</p><p>To old lions and foxes.
