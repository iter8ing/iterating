PBS a YouTube of sorts for old people (and me).</p><p>An omen of what was to come.</p><p>No one's watching Justin Wilson cook to learn how to make cajun food.</p><p>You're there to hear a story.</p><p>To hear the crowd giggle.</p><p>Food was just the medium.</p><p>The side dish.</p><p>I guarantee.</p><p>The first time I saw anything on television even remotely Asian was on cooking shows. Mostly Chinese stuff, but it does stand out because I never heard anything even close to my roots (Korea wasn't mentioned at all - China was "close enough") other than in Kung Fu movies or as villains.</p><p>These things come full circle as I see my kids reaching towards items that look like them.</p><p>Identity is strong and never yielding.</p><blockquote><p>🎵 Born in the USA! I was, Born in the USA! 🎵</p></blockquote><p>Oh snap.</p><p>Where's Old Glory?</p><p>Don't get it twisted, though. I'm a real American through and through. Like Rotundo and Windham. Hulk would be proud.</p><p>Saying prayers, eating vitamins.</p><p>[Doing the Hulk up. Shaking. Shaking. You!]</p><blockquote><p>🎵 Sent me off to a foreign land 🎵</p></blockquote><p>Heck yeah!</p><p>Let's go!</p><blockquote><p>🎵 ...to go and kill the yellow man! 🎵</p></blockquote><p>Wait what?</p><p>[Looks down at skin.]</p><p>Phew, I'm <em>gold</em>.</p><p><em>Surely, they can tell the difference!</em></p><p><em>Or are they talking about Hogan? He's pretty yellow.</em></p><p>But yeah, I loved the 80s.</p><p>If Al can cook, so can you!</p><p>🍛</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
