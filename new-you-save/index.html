Perhaps you look into stoicism.</p><p>Want to save money? The world is your oyster (make more than you spend).</p><p>Want to boost charisma? Well, look no further, champ.</p><p>[Smiling. Eyes wide open. Not blinking. Direct eye contact. Blink first, dammit.]</p><p>I'm just saying, most of us grown-ups stop with the character creation part of our own stories. We leave it all for the digital world.</p><p>And that's just silly.</p><p>I'm beginning to understand now that the old grandmasters didn't start out as young grandmasters. </p><p>They grew into it.</p><p>And that's sort of what I would like to do.</p><p>Grow into an old grandmaster character.</p><p>Although there is not much use for old grandmasters, as I knew it, so I think I'll edit it to being a more kinder, gentler, more useful old grand<em>mentor</em>.</p><p>A mentor of mentors.</p><p>Now, I just need to find the right shade of shimmery silver hair to compliment my glowing golden skin. </p><p>Be back in a few hours.</p><p>Create your character.</p><p>Create your life.</p><p>Create a new game.</p><p>Save.</p><p>[Returns a few hours later, full of shimmer and glow. Surprised to see you still sitting there. Doesn't sell it. Pretends to not see you. Gathers a few things. Leaves room. Turns off light. <em>I...I should probably head</em>, you say to yourself, as you sit blissfully in the dark, thinking about the right elbow accessory to equip that screams YOU when you get home.]</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
