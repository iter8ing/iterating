And while there are always trackers for money and items, it is ultimately your XP tally that measures and quantifies your character's life story.</p><p>As much as I love valuable stuff, I think we need a real-life XP counter.</p><p>We need a better way to quantify our value and values.</p><p>You spend enough time on this earth, you know what I'm talking about.</p><p>From highest high to lowest low, you will find that good people are everywhere (and its corollary).</p><p>And age ain't it.</p><p>Seen plenty of level one senior citizens.</p><p>So how do we quantify good character?</p><p>A good soul?</p><p>A person worth it?</p><p>Money is an easy quantifier.</p><p>But I say a terrible one.</p><p>We need a better measuring stick.</p><p>How you invest your time. Your energy. Your perspective.</p><p>This is more in nature of what I think truly brings rewards.</p><p>What's in your heart, human?</p><p>And do you show it by how you spend your life?</p><p>Of course, this presupposes a lot of things.</p><p>Presupposes you have enough to get by.</p><p>And that is a silly presupposition, as presuppositions go.</p><p>Those of you still fighting this fight are probably snickering.</p><p><em>Must be nice to think about your values when I am out here just trying to survive.</em></p><p>And to that I say:</p><p>You're right.</p><p>It <em>is</em> nice.</p><p>A luxury.</p><p>One I hope you find.</p><p>For I was once in your shoes/sandals/flip-flops/probably boots.</p><p>I would say it'll get better but I don't know if it will.</p><p>I will say I was an <em>awful</em> quantifier of my values.</p><p>And now I feel guilty buying a budget tablet from Lenovo.</p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>I love them little sheets.</p><p>Like toilet paper.</p><p>Almost disposable.</p><p>And so this is a forever (t)issue.</p><p>At least while we walk the earth.</p><p>Why are you reading this musings column?*</p><p>Don't you have anything better to do?**</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>* Thank you for reading.</p><p>** Seriously though.
