Always have.</p><p>I love what I can touch, too. Always will.</p><p>It seems we're all that way, now.</p><p>Growing up with BBSes and dial-up modems, the digital realms were left to nerds. And I was one, being Co-SysOp of a local board. It was a niche of a niche, and that made it even better.</p><p>But today, everyone wants to be online. Kids strive to be YouTubers. And you can make a living doing tangible things in an intangible world.</p><p>It's almost fading the other way. The tangible stuff is becoming the niche of a niche.</p><p>"What's wrong with him?" Was asked about those who lived on the computer and drove their family nuts by tying up the home line with a modem that screeched violently if they picked the phone up to make a call.</p><p>Now, "What's wrong with him?" is asked about a person who wants to stay off social media and keep a low profile online. Suspect by not wanting to connect.</p><p>The intangible has become too trusted. People used to be so suspicious of whoever they met online. Now, we're butchered like pigs because everyone trusts their little always-online pocket computer and the things it alerts them to.</p><p>Maybe it's the city boy in me, but I don't trust anybody.</p><p>DTA.</p><p>I was writing this to celebrate the mixture of the tangible and intangible.</p><p>I didn't mean to go so gloomy. </p><p>It's interesting because the intangible is now a very, very real part of the world.</p><p>You can get thrown in prison for actions done only in an imaginary world. </p><p>Very tangible consequences from intangible actions.</p><p>All of this to say:</p><p>It's <em>weird</em>, right?</p><p>I can't put my finger on it, but it's just really weird.</p><p>There's no difference now, between digital and analog.</p><p>It's just one big thing.</p><p>And it's only getting bigger.</p><p>This is weird, right?</p><p>I live on the corner of digital and analog, but I repeat myself.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
