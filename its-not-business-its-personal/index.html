And as a private person, the question then becomes: How personal do I want to get?</p><p>Where am I right now?</p><p>I'm good. I'm really good. Lucky. Blessed.</p><p>It wasn't always this way. Or maybe it was, but I didn't see it.</p><p>I see now.</p><p>They say youth is wasted on the young. But maybe it really is wisdom wasted on the old.</p><p>I sure am wiser than I used to be. But maybe I'm just getting old.</p><p>In the 80s, there was this curmudgeon of a wrestler named Terry Funk, a Texas cowboy heel who they would call "Middle-Aged and Crazy!" He used to brand our heroes with an iron from his ranch and swing his fists at ghosts. I used to love to hate him.</p><p>But he makes more sense to me, now.</p><p>I'm not saying I'm crazy (I'll leave the middle aged part alone), but the things I've done in my life probably only would make sense to few.</p><p>I'm being vague purposefully. I don't know how much I want to share. But it's always been personal, never business.</p><p>At least with me. Always personal.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright Â© iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
