And as a private person, the question then becomes: How personal do I want to get?</p><p>Where am I right now?</p><p>I'm good. I'm really good. Lucky. Blessed.</p><p>It wasn't always this way. Or maybe it was, but I didn't see it.</p><p>I see now.</p><p>They say youth is wasted on the young. But maybe it really is wisdom wasted on the old.</p><p>I sure am wiser than I used to be. But maybe I'm just getting old.</p><p>In the 80s, there was this curmudgeon of a wrestler named Terry Funk, a Texas cowboy heel who they would call "Middle-Aged and Crazy!" He used to brand our heroes with an iron from his ranch and swing his fists at ghosts. I used to love to hate him.</p><p>But he makes more sense to me, now.</p><p>I'm not saying I'm crazy (I'll leave the middle-aged part alone), but the things I've done in my life probably only would make sense to few.</p><p>I'm being vague purposefully. I don't know how much I want to share. But it's always been personal, never business.</p><p>At least with me. Always personal.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating.
