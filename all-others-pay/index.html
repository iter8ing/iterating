Pure freedom rarely leads to order. Free justice is self-enforced. Often meaning you have no ability to right many wrongs.</p><p>One of the legal tenets of truly owning something is that your ownership right is recognized and defended by a <em>mature</em> body and system of law.</p><p>Someone wrongs you, you have the ability to fight back with the law.</p><p>And I'm seeing so many stories involving crypto scams where the only lesson is a cautionary one.</p><p>Hogs slaughtered.</p><p>And many are like, "Why isn't anyone helping me?"</p><p>Well, this is part of what they signed up for.</p><p>No one can help.</p><p>All of this is still new, relatively speaking, and more regulation and rules are kinda the antithesis of this movement.</p><p>So how do you own things in this decentralized future?</p><p>In many ways, it's caveman era stuff.</p><p>Protect your own.</p><p>Survive.</p><p>Brutal.</p><p>Me?</p><p>I like having a system of accountability.</p><p>I like ownership rights.</p><p>I don't necessarily trust all authority, but I do trust some, especially those that have my back.</p><p>More than I trust someone who says they can get rich quick and they can show me how to do it too.</p><p>More than I trust some of these folks who treat this as a religion or as a way to save the world.</p><p>It's not either, man. It's just money or something like it.</p><p>I knew something was off with this whole decentralized thing when they said the best way to technologically secure and future-proof your stuff was to write it all down on paper. Not on your computer!</p><p>Never your computer!</p><p>Paper!</p><p>Or hammer it on metal!</p><p>Or these little devices that do not connect to the internet, promise!</p><p>Trust!</p><p>Trust no one, they say, except you have to trust those selling you this stuff.</p><p>You have to trust them.</p><p>"You can trust us in a trust-no-one world."</p><p>Trust us so you don't have to trust anyone (else).</p><p>And so the irony of a trustless world is you still have to trust those who are hocking its wares and thumping its bible.</p><p>You have to trust their trustless stuff.</p><p>And that's the hard part.</p><p>"Trust no one, except all of us. We are telling the truth. And we wouldn't ever think of stealing your stuff."</p><p>Sounds familiar.</p><p>But what do I know?</p><p>DTA.</p><p>Don't trust anybody.</p><p>Even me.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
