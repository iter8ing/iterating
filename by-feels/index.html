Not sight. Well, I think we had an overhead projector that showed where the keys were, but we couldn't look down at the keys for help.</p><p>We had to train our fingers to know which letters they were responsible for.</p><p>The pinkies had the least responsibility, whereas the index and middle got the brunt.</p><p>Anyways, my point being, perhaps I can type with my eyes closed.</p><p>I can peek at the keys but I know when my fingers strike true.</p><p>This is not an ideal way to write, but I somehow feel more attuned to writing this way.</p><p>My eyes aren't fighting the screen, I'm keeping them mostly closed, just my fingers hunting the board. I know this seems like a cruel twist of fate, but I have learned we just never know what's going to happen and that there is no sustained new normals.</p><p>Only seasons. Windows of time.</p><p>Take nothing for granted.</p><p>I can type this way. Not sure how great I'll write. But I suppose you could have asked that all along.</p><p>I can write with my eyes closed. What a blessing that is. I hope to share more substantive stuff in the near future. But forgive me any typos. </p><p>The key to typing by feel is knowing where you are. I touch my index fingers together to make sure they are aligned and in the right position. Otherwise, it's anarchy.</p><p>What I am learning is that I must write. If only for myself. And some times, many times, all the time, when you must have something, you are tested.</p><p>So, I suppose, this is some sort of test.</p><p>That's ok. </p><p>And, as I have learned to say, even in nonoptimal conditions, what does this make possible?</p><p>I just realized, for the first time ever, that the "j" and "f" keys (where your index fingers rest), have a little notch at the bottom. None of the other keys do. I think this is so you know where to orient them. Where to rest them.</p><p>I remember doing that now. When learning to type. I would peel a corner of a sticker for each hand, so I could feel a certain letter. I'd peel the corner up on "a" and "l" keys so I knew where they were by feel, fi not by sight.</p><p>Have "f" and "j" always been so distinguished? Weird, I never noticed.</p><p>I will now. </p><p>All because I starting writing by feel.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
