You only know caves and tunnels and passages and nothing else. Everyone lives this way.</p><p>And one day, you hear about this ultimate attraction.</p><p>It's at the end of a tunnel that leads up. Impossibly up.</p><p>And if you have enough money, you can pay to go there.</p><p>And the few people who have gone rave about it forever.</p><p>They just can't believe it's there.</p><p>So you save up, wait for your window (because it's only open during certain hours), and you go.</p><p>You pay the enormous admission fee and see for yourself.</p><p>And you climb up this ladder for seemingly forever in this narrow tunnel which leads to a little room with a hole in the ceiling.</p><p>And through the opening you can see it.</p><p>The above world.</p><p>The outside world.</p><p>The night's sky.</p><p>And more importantly, the unlimited (give or take) amount of stars in the sky.</p><p>And you sit and stare in awe.</p><p>Forever changed.</p><p>You'll spend the rest of your life underground talking about what you saw.</p><p>Most will never believe you.</p><p>And I suppose that's what I mean by sacralizing.</p><p>We don't sacralize the night's starry skies because it is just so routine for us.</p><p>But if we lived underground, and had to pay to see the stars, we would sacralize it.</p><p>Because it deserves it.</p><p>And I remember Rogan telling this story and just thinking how right he was.</p><p>How we would make it a holy pilgrimage to see the night's lights.</p><p>If it just wasn't available almost every single night of our lives.</p><p>And that's the trick of sacralization.</p><p>You make it sacred even though, and especially because, it is so routine.</p><p>Yes, it is just what happens on a clear evening.</p><p>Stars just show themselves.</p><p>But it is also something sacred.</p><p>Both can be true.</p><p>Both are true.</p><p>And so, 'tis the season to remember such things.</p><p>How beautiful things are that you see everyday.</p><p>It doesn't make them less important, I argue it does the exact opposite.</p><p>The beautiful and important things you see everyday are more beautiful and more important because you see them everyday.</p><p>Not less.</p><p>I've learned the best things in life are free.</p><p>But you have to earn them to keep them.</p><p>Understand?</p><p>So next time, maybe every time from here on out, you look up and see a million stars, you experience it as if you had to spend your life's savings earned living underground to see it.</p><p>And the realization that hey, <em>hey</em>, this is just given to me.</p><p>And do that, do that same thing, when you look down, and from side to side while you're at it.</p><p>And I think, <em>I think</em>, that's the secret recipe to all of this.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
