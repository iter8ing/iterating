Or if I get there, I probably won't be able to do much about it.</p><p>So 250th we will celebrate.</p><p>'Merica.</p><p>It's weird to me to live in a time where patriotism is considered by some as bad.</p><p>Where waving Old Glory can get you hurt.</p><p>At least here. On home turf.</p><p>That's weird, to me.</p><p>I love this country.</p><p>My country.</p><p>Tis of thee.</p><p>I'd wear yellow and red and shake and beat up heels, but yellow and red ain't my colors.</p><p>I'm more rose gold.</p><p>I tell you what, though, things are very interesting.</p><p>I think there is a war going on.</p><p>But instead of good versus evil, it's a little more nuanced. A little easier to spot.</p><p>I'd say it is the beautiful versus the ugly.</p><p>There is a war on beautiful.</p><p>Usually fought by uglies.</p><p>And I hate to say it, but we outnumbered.</p><p>That's right, that was just a sneaky way to say I think I'm beautiful.</p><p>A beautiful patriot. I'm a Giants fan so that "p" will stay lowercase.</p><p>Speaking of Harbaugh, I recall a story he and his brother shared about their father. How every morning, as he dropped his two sons off at school, he would say the same thing.</p><blockquote><p>"Now, boys, I want you to attack this day with an enthusiasm previously unknown to mankind."</p></blockquote><p>I heard that decades ago and I still remember it verbatim. Because, man, if that ain't America, well I don't what is.</p><p>Now, I'd say that to you right now, but I'm not your daddy. </p><p>Unless my kids are reading this, then, of course I am your daddy.</p><p>I'm talking to these other people who want me to coach them.</p><p>Who want me to mentor them.</p><p>Somewhere between 250 and 300, I might be available, but not today.</p><p>Not this year.</p><p>This year, I celebrate some important birthdays.</p><p>To singing your anthem perfectly.</p><p>And motivational founding fathers.</p><p>Happy birthday.</p><p>🇺🇸</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
