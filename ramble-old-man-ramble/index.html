More than the not lifting thing. Which shocks me, writing that truth.</p><p>I started listening to stories and watching them.</p><p>And that helped, a lot, but it did not replace writing.</p><p>And so, all of that to just say, I'm very thankful to be able to type away again. To meander in my brain and pluck what I find and place it down on digital paper.</p><p>To ramble again, if no longer to rumble.</p><p>Rumbling is a young man's game.</p><p>Writing can be an old man's.</p><p>Something to look forward to (no old man here).</p><p>This might come across as sort of a down thing, but it's not. </p><p>It's the exact opposite.</p><p>An up thing.</p><p>I'm writing again.</p><p>Wrote everyday here since early October.</p><p>I'm back, baby!</p><p>Or, at least, I am <em>here</em>.</p><p>I still get things off my chest, just now in a different form.</p><p><em>Lightweight, easy, easy</em>.</p><p>What an interesting timeline.</p><p>To the last day of a good year.</p><p>Happy.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
