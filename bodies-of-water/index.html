Great Lakes. The Bay. Korea.</p><p>I like and have always liked living by the water.</p><p>I think I like the water because it soothes my fire. It cools it down. Let's me chill. But I'm careful to never let it put it out.</p><p>My whole life, water has called to me. And yet, I don't really get in. It's the city boy in me. I like to sit by it. I like to watch my family revel and frolic in it.</p><p>It is my opposite, water is. And as such, I respect it so. And while I draw near it, touching it, I always keep it a bit away from my heart.</p><p>This is why the peninsula is my way. It juts out into the water, even surrounds itself in it, but it is always rooted into the mainland. Sticks its head and neck out, but maintains a firm foundation. A solid plan, as plans go.</p><p>I remember the first time I saw the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>It's ferocity humbled me; I stood in awe of it. How it smashed and swept what it wanted to, paying no mind to the little dot of H2O and fire watching it.</p><p>I'm more of a lake guy, now.</p><p>If you think it's because I'm getting older, you're probably right. And because the fire's not as bright. This makes my life easier. Easier and better. </p><p>Oceans, lakes, humans. My favorite bodies of water (not necessarily in that order).</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
