You could see it in his eyes.</p><p>And he sweetly recalled telling her over the years, time and time again, that he's got a lot more yesterdays than she does. But, and more importantly, she has a lot more tomorrows.</p><p>This wasn't a happy show, because he shares this knowing his daughter has passed on, and he says he's now living with only yesterdays. No more tomorrows for him.</p><p>And I feel his pain.</p><p>I found his story profoundly touching.</p><p>How we have a (predetermined?) allotment of yesterdays and tomorrows.</p><p>I have a lot of yesterdays in my life. I'd like to think I have a bunch of tomorrows coming. Same for my loved ones. Especially those with not a lot of yesterdays racked up. A whole mountain of tomorrows. A starfaring stack of 'em.</p><p>But we simply do not know.</p><p>I don't know.</p><p>I only hope.</p><p>I wish.</p><p>I pray.</p><p>And I know there is so much truth in a life <em>well</em> lived being worth far more than a life <em>long</em> lived. </p><p>But I wish more than anything, as a father, for far more tomorrows for my children than I have had yesterdays. And that someday, they remember their yesterdays as being as sweet as my todays.</p><p>They say only the good die young, and I believe that (to some degree), but that doesn't mean the good can't die old.</p><p><em>Only</em> the good die young.</p><p>Not <em>all</em> of the good.</p><p><em>Some</em> good die old.</p><p>This, like many things, makes me so grateful for the right nows.</p><p>To the well lived, long life.</p><p>And to yesterdays, tomorrows, and everything in between.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
