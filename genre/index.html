A comedy?</p><p>A tragedy?</p><p>A redemption story?</p><p>A love story?</p><p>Or an epic trilogy, perhaps?</p><p>How about a reality show?</p><p>True crime?</p><p>Paranormal?</p><p>Where you at?</p><p>When you on?</p><p>Sorry, this is just what I do.</p><p>When I want to learn more about something or someone, I ask a lot of questions of it.</p><p>Mostly, I never ask a question, though.</p><p>Not interested.</p><p>Hard pass.</p><p><em>Yawns</em>.</p><p>Next!</p><p>I have always felt like an outsider.</p><p>Always been an outsider.</p><p>Too much this to be that. Too much that to be this.</p><p>I liked to lift heavy things, even if only to open and read them.</p><p>Too New York for Cali. Too Cali for New York. Too Midwest to be Southern. Too Korean. Not enough Korean. Too Midwest to care about it at all (after a <em>looooooooong</em> long long  time). Long duck.</p><p>And so that's my answer.</p><p>Sort of.</p><p>My outsiderness has given me the unique opportunity to find a home everywhere, with everyone.</p><p>With exiles and executives.</p><p>Janitors and jet flyers.</p><p>Rolexes and Timexes.</p><p>Noobs and grandmasters.</p><p>And let me tell you: Good people are rarely the star of their show.</p><p>The "stars" are usually asses.</p><p>Ass.</p><p>Es.</p><p>I mean, there are probably jerk janitors. </p><p>But do I have to convince you a CEO is a hole of buttocks?</p><p>Didn't think so.</p><p>And believe me, most CEOs think they are the leading man or lady.</p><p>Actually, I have no idea.</p><p>I don't care, really. Just seems like an easy and obvious example.</p><p><em>Yawns</em>.</p><p>Every life story, in the end, is a complete mashup of all of the above.</p><p>I simplify it and say every story is a love story. But really, in a life truly lived, you have elements of tragedy, drama, comedy, adventure, action, love, and redemption.</p><p>All of the above.</p><p>The order is important, I think.</p><p>A show about true crime ending in love and redemption - well that sounds pretty good.</p><p>A show about comedy and action ending in tragedy? Eek. Probably would get better ratings, though.</p><p>I'll end it here.</p><p>To be continued.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
