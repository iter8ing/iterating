I mean, I did forget.</p><p>But no time like the present.</p><p>My goal is to write at least once a day. And while no one's really paying attention, I'm paying attention. That means something, at least to me. Maybe someone in the future, too.</p><p>If you ever have the good fortune to love someone, my goodness, what a thing.</p><p>And the thing about love is it makes you stronger and weaker at the same time. </p><p>Love gives you strength beyond measure, but it can also leave you so vulnerable in many ways.</p><p>Heartbreaks are audible, visceral, and as true as any compound fracture. And I'm not just talking romantic ones. It's about affection and concern. Strength and weakness.</p><p>I don't know why I write about love today -- who knows why I write about anything.</p><p>I've been hearing a lot of people are giving up on love, which just seems foolish.</p><p>Love seems reserved for only those of flesh and bone. Will ai ever know love?</p><p>Humans can fall in love with anything.</p><p>Strength and weakness.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
