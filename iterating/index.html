Just to see if I can do it.</p><p>I wonder how sustainable it is to just type by feel. </p><p>Don't get me wrong, I can still see. I'm fine.</p><p>It's just typing on my computer has suddenly turned... off.</p><p>I think I have sensitivity to certain screens. Too much flashing/refreshing/wa wah.</p><p>As someone who loves tech, this is a bit of a bummer. But I'm going to roll with it. I'm in no shape to complain. I just will figure a work around.</p><p>Closing my eyes to type is the first workaround.</p><p>Writing by feel.</p><p>I've been a bit under the weather so that's probably the reason.</p><p>Who knows.</p><p>What I know is that this writing thing is wired into my OS and I'm not going to stop over some vision thing.</p><p>I wish I had something more to say it's just not going to happen until I get into a groove with this eyes closed typing thing.</p><p>Living up to this site's domain name.</p><p>Hypothesis. Testing. Receiving feedback. Updating based on feedback. New hypothesis. More testing.</p><p>And so on.</p><p>This whole iterating thing is relatively new to me.</p><p>I used to only want to be perfect. Never fail. And I wasn't bad at it. But this made me not try the hardest things. Or prepare for them. I just jumped into them. Head first. </p><p>Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it made a great story.</p><p>However, this was a weakness in my youth. </p><p>I can write blind.</p><p>I <em>will</em> write blind.</p><p>But I can see.</p><p>See?</p><p>The only way to get to perfect is to fail. Over and over.</p><p>I know that now.</p><p>Jordan had to fight the Bad Boys (and lose - over and over).</p><p>Lose first. Win later.</p><p>You can't stop this ess. This thing overflowing.</p><p>My font runneth over.</p><p>I love fonts.</p><p>Ok, goodbye for now.</p><p>Oh, and if you ever run into past me, tell me you read my future website and that you're a time traveler and there's this small window of time where I can't see my screen so good and that everything will be fine except you're not sure because you had to jump into the time machine again before you could read any more posts.</p><p>Oh, and make sure you tell past me, that future me loves him.</p><p>Man, I could go on forever.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Copyright © Iterating</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://iterating.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
